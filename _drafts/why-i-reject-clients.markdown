Lately, I've had to completely drop clients, refuse to do any sort of work on the side for others, and do a lot of screening before agreeing to even look at a project in more detail.

Why?

Mostly because I'm extremely busy and I have a day job - people that I know, know that I work in IT, so naturally, they ask me for help.  I have to have a way to filter people out so that the people who I do end up working for on the side, end up making it much more worthwhile to exchange my bits of free time for working on a project.

Almost too often do I receive requests to work on a project for sweat equity, with the promise that their project will be "the next big thing."  The easiest way for me to figure out whether they're great to work with or will end up as relying too much on my talents with nothing in return, is to look at their prior work and see where they're best at.  Do they mesh with what I do?  Do they have any experience in what I would be doing for them?  It's a totally different story if you're hiring someone because you'd rather concentrate on something else, vs. hiring someone because you don't have any skills in that particular skill area.  Not necessarily saying that it's bad if you don't have skills in programming/sysadmin'ing, but it must be more than made up in skills in other areas in order to convince me to work on a project for you.
