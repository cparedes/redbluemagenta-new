A friend of mine wrote an article on [his switch from iOS to Android, then back over to iOS].  He has a lot of good points, and I agree on many of them.  A lot of the customization is only really obvious to those who tinker around with devices already, which I definitely can identify with (that's the reason why I went for an N900 from the get go, though the execution was so poor that I ended up going with another platform.)

There's a couple of things I wanted to address which I believe is inaccurate:

1. AV scanners/security.  The Android platform is in fact quite secure; it has per-application isolation and it does a pretty damn good job in enforcing that.  Of course, it leaves all of the decisions up to the user - whenever you install an app, there's a separate screen that details which part of the system that the app is allowed to access, and it asks the user if they agree with said permissions.  Of course every person is just going to click through, but you can be rest assured that everything displayed on that screen is exactly what's enforced on the system by Android.  Also, AV scanners on the Android are almost meaningless - from what I've read, all it does is figure out if any apps installed match against a central database of apps that are known to be bad.  That's it.  There's also bad apples in the iOS App Store, and you still have to practice vigilance if you want to avoid bad apps.
