What do these three have in common?

They all do not amount for much in the long run.

Badges, if you choose to pursue them, are simply markers that have all but
lost their meaning as soon as you've chosen to pursue the badge, and not
the challenge that goes along with it.

Accolades are the same, except you can't even physically show anyone what
you're proud of.

Recognition is good in moderation.  But people forget who you are in time,
if you pursue only recognition for recognition's sake.
