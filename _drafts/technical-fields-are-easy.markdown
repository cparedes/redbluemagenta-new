*(NOTE: This is inspired by many discussions of the topic on [Hacker News].)*

I know what many of you guys are thinking: "that's impossible, the time sink
and intellectual transactions one must take in order to even have an inkling
of a technical concept makes technical fields HARD."  But think of it this
way: it's quite easy to understand another person in the field, and the
systems we create are always usually as simple as we can create them.
