When people hear "system administration", they wonder what exactly that is.
I try to explain using analogies or extreme examples, such as the hidden sorts
of complexities of tunnels and plumbing (I have to thank Ben Krueger for that
analogy), or saying something like, "wonder why some websites seem to always
be up?  It's because people like me are there, trying to make sure that issues
that threaten such responsiveness and availability are mitigated."

Then usually what happens (though not always) is that the conversation steers
toward fixing printers, viruses, etc.
