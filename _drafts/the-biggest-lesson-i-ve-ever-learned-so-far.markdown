I've only been on this earth for 24 years and haven't experienced much of
anything compared to many people, but after diving into the business world
head first right after college, I've personally finally internalized a lesson
that my elders and parents have always tried to instill in me:

**Be honest.**

So far, this one piece of advice has helped me in more ways than one.
Especially in fields where it's extremely easy to see through someone's
bullshit, being honest is a very reasonable and pragmatic tenet that one can
take.  In fact, you can do absolutely no wrong if you're upfront and honest
with everything - future employers will respect you for it, you'll develop
a reputation for having high integrity, and you'll save *everyone* from
any future trouble.

I believe the reason why this never stuck to me as starkly as it did in recent
memory is not because I've been a deceiving asshole up until this point,
but because, in many cases, there has never been any opportunity to see
exactly what honesty brings to the table.  In many respects, it seemed to
be simply another Platonic Ideal - a convenient tenet to strive for but never
able to reach.

You may not be able to negotiate for a strong salary right away (because
you would never really attempt to inflate what you know), but the strong
connections you'll get with people is worth more than the salary - it means
you get to be employed in the industry for as long as you can.  People talk,
and if the subject of the conversation is how you haven't been totally
forthright in your dealings with people, then those people who would employ
you would not want to hire you.
