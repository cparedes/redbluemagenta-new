title: A justification of job hopping in today's market
categories:

I'm getting a bit of a reputation of being a "job hopper."  I've had four or
five jobs within the past year after I've graduated, and all I can really
blame is myself.  Call this post a self-justification of my behavior, but
I believe there's a good reason why one ought to job hop in today's economy.

**WARNING: This will not work if you are not in demand in the marketplace!
I also do not recommend this outside of the tech industry, as it's much more
commonplace in the tech industry than anywhere else.**

The first reason why one ought to job hop is if one wants to grab as much
experience as possible in a short period of time.  Yes, you won't get the
sort of depth of experience that one might have if they stick around for a year
or two, but when you've just graduated from college, it's important to pick up
as much breadth of knowledge as possible, so that you know for sure what you
really want to do as a "career".

However, the second reason has to do with the notion of "careers" in the
tech industry: since there's so much happening in such a fast pace in the
tech industry, *especially* in non-enterprise areas of the industry, it's
*impossible* to hold a traditional sense of a career where you can be placed
in a really focused path and expect to do the same job with the same tools
for the rest of your life.  The only hope we have in specialization, as
technical professionals in computing, is to focus our energies in fairly
general areas of interest, such as security, performance tuning, or what
have you.  But even then, is this a foolhardy approach to take, since even
the notion of infrastructure as a service (IaaS) such as EC2 has destroyed
much of our expectations on how to build systems...

The third reason why one ought to job hop has to do with job satisfaction.
Those who wish to continually develop their skills in a particular field
[usually max out the amount of value they can add to an organization after
roughly a year or two][1]. This is much more apparent today than it was twenty
years ago.  Once you reach the value apex, the job starts to get boring...
and while there's something to be said about sticking it out, despite boring
work, sometimes it makes sense to jump ship for more interesting work.

I believe that no one *really* wants to leave their job so quickly.  In fact,
as soon as people find a job that they really like, they try really hard to
keep that job and stay on for as long as possible.  With that being said,
I also believe that job hoppers are simply trying to find that position,
and would rather cut off a job than stick it out, so they don't waste anyone's
time.

Trust me, I'm not completely proud of my job history so far, though I am
proud of the few things I was able to build for companies within the year.
