So, I've had a little bit of a mishap a few weeks ago when I was upgrading my NetBSD kernel.  All of the kernels lived on a separate partition, though I've mistakenly written over a few superblocks of my root partition when I was writing to the /boot partition.  Oops.

I figure this is a great opportunity for me to start fresh with a new site design and a new set of blog posts.  Instead of talking only about technical stuff, I'll talk about both that and the regular stuff I usually like talking about, like philosophy, mathematics, and other subjects.
