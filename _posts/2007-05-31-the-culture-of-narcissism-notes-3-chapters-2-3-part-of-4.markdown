It seems that the word "narcissism" is, nowadays, often attributed to every sort of selfish act, which eliminates the historic specificity that is needed to analyze the trend of human interaction.

"New Narcissism" is characterized by the following behavioral symptoms: fear of dependence, sense of inner emptiness, boundless repressed rage, and unsatisfied oral cravings.

There are also secondary traits: pseudo self-insight, calculating seductiveness, nervous, self-deprecatory humor.

Since the critics of narcissism fail to investigate the psychological aspect of narcissism in fear of obfuscating the social impact of the phenomenon, they, ironically, do indeed obfuscate the social impact and fail to reveal the characteristics of contemporary culture, such as the fear of old age and death, altered sense of time, fascination with celebrity, fear of competition, decline of the play spirit, and deteriorating relations between men and women.

(lists above are quoted directly from the book)

There's a ton of Freudian psychology floating around in the second chapter, with Lasch often using psychoanalysis as a means to explain overall social problems.  It proves as a way to investigate the individual as a product of the society that his personality is rooted in; neuroses and psychoses is, thus, a sort of expression of a given culture.

Clinical writing has seemingly recognized narcissism as an important element in the "character disorders" that are now observed by psychiatrists rather than hysteria and obsessive neuroses that were investigated before.

Secondary narcissism (as opposed to primary narcissism, which is observed in infants when they perceive their mothers as having a combined existence with themselves) is rooted in the attempts to annul the pain of disappointed object love.  Separation and frustration from such object love leads the person in question to create fantasies of an omnipotent mother or father; they wish to recreate a wished for love relationship and to annul anxiety and guilt aroused by aggressive drives directed against the frustrating and disappointing object. (paraphrased)

Experiences of rage and envy are compensated by fantasies of wealth, beauty, and omnipotence, along with images of the good parents he has conjured in his mind.  These lend to a core of the "grandiose conception of the self."

Constant projection of "bad" self and object images perpetuate an image of a dangerous world with threatening objects, where "good" self images are used defensively, and ideal self images are built up.

This seems to be in line with the rise of self-help psychology, where we try to conceive of an ideal image in order to obtain an ideal result from a world that is perceived as dangerous.

Intense feelings of emptiness and inauthenticity in a modern world seem to be motivated by the thinly populated intrapsychic world of the patient, where the population only consists of the "grandiose self."  Thus, anything lesser than the "grandiose self," namely the "true self" and other people, are devalued.

The narcissist attaches himself to constant approval and admiration from other people, living in an almost parasitic existence with others.  However, the narcissist also fears emotional dependence and uses a manipulative approach to personal relations, making said parasitic relations bland, superficial, and highly unsatisfying.  He is chronically bored and in search of instantaneous intimacy, thus usually making the narcissist promiscuous and pansexual.

The narcissist is always looking for therapeutic solutions to his sense of emptiness, often looking toward religion or a way of life, as a way to find external support for his fantasies of omnipotence and eternal youth.

To enjoy life with a growing identification with other people's successes and happiness seems to be largely impossible and beyond the capacity of those with narcissistic personalities.

Shift of personalities: the capable "organization man" to the bureaucratic "gamesman," where the efficient workings of the work place in dealing with materials turns toward dealing with people in the office.  Accumulation of wealth and building an empire is thrown in the back while the exhilaration of gaining victories and running a team come to the forefront.  That is, it seems that self-esteem is also now a central portion of running a company, where winning is the deepest joy and losing is deeply feared.  Getting ahead of others is the goal, not getting ahead.  The gamesman seems to be devoid of convictions and morals, where he will deal with any organization, no matter how unscrupulous it may be, just to get ahead of others around him.  The modern executive relies on the admiration or fear he inspires in others so he can solidify his credentials as a "winner."  However, when the adolescent thrills of winning are lost, the gamesman starts to become depressed and goalless, with no sense of purpose in his life.  He realizes he is alone in a sort of "midlife crisis."

Quick aside: this relates a lot to chapter 4, where Lasch deals with the issue of politics in America with narcissism at the forefront.  The government, more infatuated with its image rather than with the truth and caution, will rely more on the charisma and "truthiness" of an event or a set of data in order to convince the public of their ability to solve problems.  This, along with contemporary media, gives a more unrealistic view of the world seemingly disconnected from historical context, which relies more on imagery rather than what is actually happening.

Bureaucracy and mechanical reproduction of culture are two of several social influences of bringing a narcissistic personality out to the forefront.  Photographs, television, etc. lends itself to showing the viewer that, yes, he himself might be judged as if he will be put on photograph himself.  We then know now that we need not be reminded to smile, because we already have a smile graven on our faces, and of course it is the perfect smile that we know looks best in several angles.

This sort of proliferation of recorded images in modern culture undermines our sense of reality.  Photographic images are a sort of proof of our own existence.  Compared to the 18th and 19th century portraits - which were painted in order to express a bourgeois family's status - today's imagery is simply a validation of our own existence.

Modern medicine seems to have also created insecurities in potential patients; any blemishes, signs of aging, etc. are easily fixable by modern medicine, but are thus constantly sought out by potential patients in order to ensure that they are without disease and blemishes.

Great quote at the end of a particular section:

<blockquote>Nothing succeeds like the appearance of success.</blockquote>

Celebrity/envy is seen as more important in contemporary culture than respect/privacy.

In fact, private life is now pervaded by public life, taking on characteristics of the antagonisms presented in public life and becoming more and more warlike.  Self-help books now emphasize the cocktail party as a battleground of social manipulation and wit, with the goal of being the center of attention no matter the cost.

Americans have become more adept at exploiting interpersonal relations for their own benefit.  Most activities now have the goal of simply doing others in.

Marquis de Sade imagined a sexual utopia where everyone is absolutely anonymous and interchangeable, thus reducing the human to a market value.  Sade was the first to realize that in organized anarchy, pleasure becomes life's only business, with no distinction between sex, rape, murder, and unbridled aggression.  Immediate gratification of every desire, no matter how criminal, insane, or immoral it may be, is a consequence of reducing reason to mere calculation.

Another quote from the end of chapter 3:

<blockquote>The bourgeois defense of privacy culminates - not just in Sade's thought but in the history to come, so accurately foreshadowed in the very excess, madness, infantilism of his ideas - in the most thoroughgoing attack on privacy; the glorification of the individual, in his annihilation.</blockquote>

Advertising changed from informing the viewer of the truths of the product in the 19th century (and possibly early 20th century) to inciting a feeling of restlessness, unsatisfaction, anxiety, and boredom in the consumer in contemporary culture.  Advertising now promotes consumption as a way of life rather than simply informing the viewer of the product.  Objects take on the aura of romance with allusions to exotic places and vivid experiences, and, as Lasch points out quite nicely, "with images of female breasts from which all blessings flow."

Alienation itself turns into a commodity; desolation of modern life is shown to be cured by consumption, which in turn creates or exacerbates new forms of unhappiness, such as personal insecurity, status anxiety, etc.

Advertising also latches onto the "sexual revolution," where women are "liberated" from male oppression and the young from authority of their elders.  Freedom to consume is disguised as genuine autonomy.

ALRIGHT, finally, I'm done writing for now.  This was a long fucking post.  Hopefully you guys reached the end of this thing unscathed.
