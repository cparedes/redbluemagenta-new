I should read some of Kierkegaard's works sometime.

I read a little bit of his works in one of my philosophy classes back in Seattle University, though I never really got into it.  We mention Kierkegaard quite a bit in passing in my Philosophy of Religion class as a sort of third opinion on whatever analytical methods we use to try deducing various things about God, religion, etc.

And now I'm really interested in reading Kierkegaard.  Why?  His views on faith depend on a "suspension of doubt," where we leap in even if the religion might be very wrong in its underpinnings.  An example that my professor brought up is a person running into a burning house with little chance of him surviving with an even lower chance of him finding anyone alive inside the house, yet he runs in with faith that he will be able to find someone who is alive and can try to save him.  It's irrational, but it's the transcendence of logic that makes one have faith in God.

In any case, there still should be logical underpinnings for at least the reasoning why one ought to have faith in God, since we often run into the problem of circular reasoning ("Yes, I kneel and bow because I believe in God.  Why do I believe in God?  Because I kneel and bow"), as well as blind belief without totally "leaping into faith."

But yeah, the reason why I'm more inclined to lean toward Kierkegaard's philosophy is because God escapes all reason, and to place a logical framework on faith is to completely destroy the essence of faith.  I also think that while science provides a great framework in creating models that are backed up by falsifiable research, it does not provide a complete view of the truth as it exists outside of the frameworks of science, since empirical research is inherently biased toward our unique mode of interpreting the world.

Eh, who knows, I titled this blog post with today's date since my views on religion shifts every now and then, so be sure to keep a look out for "Views on religion as of 11/04/07/." :)
