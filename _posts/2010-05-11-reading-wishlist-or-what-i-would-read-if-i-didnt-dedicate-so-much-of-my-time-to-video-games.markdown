I've been keeping a mental list of books I've been meaning to read and will hopefully start reading sometime in the near future.  It's been way too long that I've read books out of my own interest and enjoyment rather than for work or for school, and so I want to get this jump started again for my own sake.

<ol>
<li><em>Infinite Jest</em> by David Foster Wallace</li>
<li><em>A First Course in Probability</em> by Sheldon Ross (why oh why didn't I take any statistics/probability courses in college?)</li>
<li><em>War and Peace</em> by Leo Tolstoy (I've read through roughly 2/3rds of the book in the past)</li>
<li><em>The Brothers Karamazov</em> by Fyodor Dostoyevsky</li>
<li><em>Crime and Punishment</em> by Fyodor Dostoyevsky</li>
<li><em>Frankenstein</em> by Mary Shelley (I've read through this twice before)</li>
<li><em>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</em> by Philip K. Dick</li>
<li><em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> by Immanuel Kant (I've only read selections of his philosophical writings, and was taught from secondary sources about his overall position.)</li>
</ol>

Possibly more to come...
