Okay, so I decided to watch an episode or two while my brother was watching it on the TV.  My brother says this is the best show EVER, while I look on and witness clich√© plot twists, cliffhangers, and crappy dialogue.

Case in point:

Dude - "I want to buy this ring for my wife"
Jeweler - "YOU DON'T WANT TO, YOU WILL BE ON AN ISLAND INSTEAD, I KNOW EVERYTHING"
Dude - "NOOOOOOO"

This... is network TV genius?  Are you fucking kidding me?  I was talking to my brother about this and said that good films in general are, in general, considered art, whereas this garbage cannot possibly be art.

Wait, why can't it be art?

Because it's network TV, they always want slick writers that use common techniques that draw people in without really adding any substance at all, which means more money for the TV company.

Anyway, I guess my main point is that all of you Lost fans suck too for liking Lost.
