For those interested, [I've posted my presentation on my website](/docs/casitconf.pptx).  I've written it in PowerPoint 2011, so you might have to convert it down if you can't open pptx files.

I talk about Chef in the presentation - was hoping there was an audio or video recording, but alas, all you can have is my slide deck. :)

EDIT: It's also now on [scribd].
