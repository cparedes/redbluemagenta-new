So, I've recently started my new job over at a research lab down in UW SLU, and it's going great so far.  For now, I've been doing inventory of all of the computers that we own in the lab (it's about 15 or so, not too bad), doing disk backups, a little manual labor, some basic technical support, and a little bit of research into a few pieces of software.  But I guess soon I'll be getting a Linux desktop for me to fool around with, as well as making sure that a Linux server that handles all of the experimental data is running smoothly.

Because of this (and because I love fucking around with Linux, and because it's been a bit too long since I've had a running system on my machine), I've decided to download and install several different distributions of Linux and run them all in VMWare. I have Fedora 10 and Gentoo 2008.0 (both x86) running on my Macbook under VMWare Fusion 2.0.1, as well as openSUSE 11.1 (x86_64) on my main desktop under VMWare Fusion 2.0.1.  I have the 64-bit versions of Fedora 10, Ubuntu 8.10, CentOS 5.2, and Arch Linux 2008.06 downloading right now, and I plan on installing all of them on my desktop within the next couple of days. I might put up short reviews of each of them, as well as my experiences on getting them to work with VMWare Fusion 2.0.1 (so far, Fedora 10 works great WITHOUT vmware-tools, and I've tried to install vmware-tools briefly last night to no result; I'll have to do a little bit more research into how to solve that problem.)  I haven't yet installed all of the fancy GUI crap on my Gentoo install yet, but that will be coming soon.

Probably after I get these VM's up and running (though my hindsight is telling me that I should've done x86 installations on my desktop, so I can easily throw them onto my Macbook!), I'll see how they fare in general and then I'll see if I can use my Macbook at work with these VM's open.  We'll see.
