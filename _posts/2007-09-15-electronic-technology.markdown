I've always tooled around with this question in my head every now and then: will I be able to sever myself from technology - or at least interconnectivity through electronic means - within the near future?

We've become enamored by the technologies and mediums that have been introduced into our society within the past one hundred years.  However, it is like an invasive parasite on our psyches that has manifested itself in all levels of societies, young and old alike.  In fact, we are introduced to these technologies when we are little kids, training us to become proficient in the art of communication in a contemporary age, where we communicate by means of phone, internet, and other sorts of mediums that add physical - and most importantly, emotional - distance between the two parties.

This has a profound effect on the way our society is shaped.  Perhaps it is of no coincidence that Seattle, my hometown, is one of the most wired cities in the country, whereas at the same time, is also well known for its coldness in human interactions (see: Seattle Freeze).

Since our entire society is now based mostly around our communicative technologies - namely, the cell phone and the internet - it is tough to throw it away entirely.  We will always encounter a societal construct that is based around this fact, which expects a type of interaction with it that requires participation motivated by our usage of the communicative medium.  However, we can ween ourselves away from these mediums little by little until we can redirect the mediums effects on our lives toward trivialities.  But it seems that we can't ever escape it, and we shouldn't expect to escape it; humans in a society act within the society, not outside nor separate from it.

Perhaps exercising other mediums of communication, like for instance, two way face to face communication, will help destroy our reliance on technology and will ultimately free us from any a-posteriori effects that these technologies have on our society.

Thoughts, anyone?
