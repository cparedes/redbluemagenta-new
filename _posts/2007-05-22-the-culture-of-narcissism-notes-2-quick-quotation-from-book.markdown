I just wanted to quote a passage from the book that seems to resonate quite strongly with me:

<blockquote>Schur himself notes that "what seems ultimately to emerge out of this very mixed message is an ethic of self-preservation."  But his condemnation of the survival ethic as a "retreat into privatism" misses the point.  When personal relations are conducted with no other object than psychic survival, "privatism" no longer provides a haven from a heartless world.  On the contrary, private life takes on the very qualities of the anarchic social order from which it is supposed to provide a refuge.  It is the devastation of personal life, not the retreat into privatism, that needs to be criticized and condemned.  The trouble with the consciousness movement is not that it addresses trivial or unreal issues but that it provides self-defeating solutions.  Arising out of a pervasive dissatisfaction with the quality of personal relations, it advises people not to make too large an investment in love and friendship, to avoid excessive dependence on others, and to live for the moment - the very conditions that created the crisis of personal relations in the first place.</blockquote>
