title: Yet another site redesign
---

So, I've decided to cut out all of the distracting fancy stuff and just go
with a very, very minimal site design this time around.  My intention is that
the content is at the forefront, and that all of the space should only be
used to house content, and nothing else.

I can easily revert back to the previous site design if people don't like this
one.  Also, as always, I've made the site available on [GitHub] if you wish
to use the site design.  The site design is licensed under the 3-clause BSD
licensed, for the exception of anything in the _plugins directory (for now)
and anything in the _posts and _drafts directories.
