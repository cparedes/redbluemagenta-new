I was spending too much time on Facebook and Myspace - although from what I hear, the amount of time I spent on Facebook and Myspace is not even all that much compared to many others - and I need that time for other things, like studying and actually doing shit outside of the internet.

I find that it is also a bit of a widespread problem: the fact of the matter is is that Facebook and Myspace fosters superficial relationships through profile pages that are more about vanity rather than actually revealing who the person is as a person.  These social networking sites, therefore, makes us more into narcissists when conversing with others in front of us.  It doesn't help that these sites are quite addicting, and thus, also wastes our time on the computer rather than doing other things that better connect us with society.

Maybe it's simply academic elitism that's driving me to do this, but I do find it to be more of a hinderance to social interaction than anything.

I personally feel that I'm better off without either website.
