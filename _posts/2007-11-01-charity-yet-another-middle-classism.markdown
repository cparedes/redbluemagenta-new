The urban middle class is slowly becoming more and more dehumanized as time goes on.  Charity, for instance, is a great example of the dehumanization of the middle class: we are absolutely fine with throwing change at a random homeless guy and writing huge checks to whatever organization for charity, yet on the same token, we will shun away any other homeless person that we don't have the mood to give money to.  All of you have probably heard it before: "they can just find a shelter and a food bank, they don't need anything from me," "this guy is way too dirty for me to do anything for him," etc.  If we view the homeless as sources of altruism, we institutionalize them into a pigeon hole and completely neglect their unique experiences as humans.

And, when we, the middle class, contribute to charitable causes, we obtain something very valuable to us: the feel good gut feeling of greatness.  Yes, the feel good gut feeling of greatness is highly valued because we often do not feel this sensation in any other instance, yet it's quite predictable that we will feel this when we contribute goods and money, and so we try to do this more often and more consistently when in fact we are cementing the pigeon hole that we have created by categorizing the homeless as sources of altruism.  There is, in effect, still a barrier between us and the homeless even if we directly contribute to a charitable cause.

On a larger scale, the American sense of charity fits right into the notion of Capitalism: we effectively barter with our economy when we contribute toward charity, since our government offers tax breaks, the organization we contributed to offers the sense of celebrity, and we lend ourselves the preprogrammed sense of the feel good gut feeling.  There is no net loss, we all gain from it, and it's, in general, still an equal bargain.  We are also quite aware of it, yet we say otherwise.

Oh, and this is my most favorite thing about this whole construct: it also offers social escalation, or, in the very least, a sense of artificial escalation.  We tend to look down upon those who do not contribute charity for any sort of reason, as if they were directly responsible for the lack of food for the poor kids on the streets, or the slaughter of babies in Darfur, or whatever.

Maybe it's because of that soft speaking person on the other side of the TV screen when kids from Africa appear on the screen, or perhaps the piano playing in the background... I don't know.  In any case, the imagery offers a feeling of contributing "all good," and so, anyone who is against contributing "good" is "bad."

I'll probably write a new post sometime in the future about how institutions in general dehumanize our societies, especially middle/upper class constructs.
