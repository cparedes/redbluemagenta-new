Hey guys.

I haven't been posting all too much lately - I've recently started over at
[Blue Box Group, LLC] and have hit the ground running.

Now that I have my breath from working here for two weeks, I can go over a few
things that's been happening as of late (not necessarily work related.)

1. Again, I've been hired by Blue Box Group as a senior system administrator.
This job is really fucking awesome - I've had several projects thrown at me
since I've started, and I'm learning quite a bit about everything. Things
are excellent on this front. This is to no detriment to my previous employer,
[3TIER].  They're an excellent group to work for, and they're awesome people
in general.  I just think, at this point in time, I need to get my feet
very much wet - this means going in head first into crazy problems right away.

2. I've been reading a lot of things... and I really should stop doing that.
Why? Because my mind is way too scatterbrained to keep focus on many things.
I think the one thing I need to sit down with, until I'm at a really good
point to stop, is probably "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs."
I'm not even through the first chapter; it's a challenging book, but a good one
to read, and I hope to learn a bit of much needed computer science training
that I've skipped over when I was in college.  While I was reading this book,
I've also found a bunch of tutorials and a few other books that I should read;
the two that stick out for me at the moment are "Web Operations," and
"Let's Build a Compiler."  "Web Operations" will likely be the next thing
I'll concentrate on, though I've read through half of the book so far.

3. I've finally ordered my tickets for LISA '10!  I've my hotel and flight
booked already, and so I'm all set for this year's LISA!  There's a chance
I'll speak about the LOPSA Mentorship Program at LISA at one of the BoF's,
but we'll see.  Can't wait to meet all of you guys in the flesh. :)

4. Finally, I've whittled down a few outstanding holes in my knowledge that
I really need to work on.  First, I'm extremely weak with databases. I've
only a cursory understanding of MySQL replication, I haven't crafted many
statements longer than a "SELECT * FROM TABLE", and I also haven't seen many
of the problems that can go wrong in a database.  Second, I'm extremely weak
with essential computer science concepts.  I don't know too many data
structures nor algorithms, which hampers a lot of things when it comes to
performance tuning and optimization of code.  The way I plan to tackle these
two deficiencies is to both tackle a ton of projects that involve exercising
both skills, and also attend conferences and read books on the subject.
I've signed up for the basic databases tutorial at LISA '10, and while this
will obviously not be exhaustive, it'll at least get the ball rolling. I
imagine a lot more reading and a lot more programming will help me with
my comp-sci-fu.

Yep. :)
