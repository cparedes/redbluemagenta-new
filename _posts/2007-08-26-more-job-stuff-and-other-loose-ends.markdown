I've typed up my resum√© for the coffee shop, which I'll hand in tomorrow morning.  I figure I can schedule myself for now as full time at the help desk job, then maybe change my schedule later if at all possible.  If not, I'll just work full time during the weekdays and maybe work five hours during the weekend over at the Allegro.

As a sidenote, I listened in to a help desk call last Friday which had a Filipino dude on the other end (it was way too obvious by the accent that he was Filipino.)  I asked my dad if he knew the guy that called in, and well, funnily enough, it's one of his good friends.  Weird how that worked out...

I really hope they don't make us stay the whole day on Monday, since the training schedule says that we are only there from 9:00 - 10:30 AM.  That shit sucked on Friday.  Shadowing for five hours straight is not fun, especially when there are practically no calls coming in.

I've been sketching a lot lately as well.  I've tons of rough sketches in my notebook, the same one that I use for solving math problems from that damned Rudin text.  I figure that since I'm starting the math and art stuff on opposite ends of the notebook, there could be some weird freakish art/math clash that I will draw in the middle once I fill the notebook up.  Aww yeah.

Yep, that's about it really for now.
