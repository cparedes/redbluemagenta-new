I've been a member of the [XDA Developers Forum][XDA] forums for a few months,
and after following development forums for various phones (mostly the Nexus
S and the HTC Thunderbolt forums), I've concluded that the XDA Developers
forums suck.  Perhaps an even stronger claim is that the Android developer
community sucks, but I won't be defending that claim in this post.

So, why does the XDA Developers forums suck?

For one, the purpose of the forums is to centralize discussion and cooperation
of development projects for Android.  Based on what I've seen so far on the
Nexus S and Thunderbolt forums, I believe that the forums have largely failed
at this task.  ROM's are largely developed independently with about over half
of the ROMs *maybe* sharing source code to the community, with the biggest
offender being CM7 for Thunderbolt (the source code for most of the OS is
shared to the public, but the most important part that adds support for the
Thunderbolt's radio will *not* be open sourced "until it's done.") Worse,
there's a lot of prima donnas in the community - in most other dev communities,
most of the work is done in teams, though there may be benevolent dictators
or celebrities (but almost none of the things that are present in the XDA
community - witholding of source code and "heroism.")  As much as slayher has
contributed to the community, it's telling when you see CM7 on Thunderbolt
completely contingent on him finishing his radio interface layer code, and
having to go to a channel called #slayher for CM7 Thunderbolt support.  Who
the fuck creates a channel based on their handle for a software project?

Not only that, but the discussion that does take place on the forums around
development is almost always centered on end user support.  Many other
communities solve this with mailing lists in order to help focus branching
topics in a thread (most forums are notoriously bad at this, given that the
default view in most forums and the way that a forum focuses your conversation
often defaults to a flat hierarchy of posts.)  Any relevant developer
discussion is drowned in a sea of user support questions, and I would not blame
anyone who wishes to take their conversation elsewhere.

What I propose as an alternative is the following:

1. A site that is an aggregate of mailing lists for various phones, software
projects associated with each phone, etc.
2. User support may be provided on this same site on forums, like how XDA
is setup right now.  The only difference is that dev discussion is separated
into mailing lists (and make it crystal clear that any developer related
discussion should be posted on the mailing lists.)
3. This site should not post anything that doesn't have any source code freely
available under the GPL/BSD/Apache/etc. licenses.
