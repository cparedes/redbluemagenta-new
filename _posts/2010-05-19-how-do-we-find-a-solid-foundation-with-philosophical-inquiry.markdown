The one lesson that I've carried with me from my formal philosophy education was that I ought to question many belief systems, including my own.  And to be honest, I have done a lot of questioning of my own beliefs throughout college, up to today.

For instance, to seed the discussion a little bit, I've often asked myself this question: have I lead a false life up to this point?  We could look toward the existentialists for some inspiration on a possible answer: our life is simply a bundle of experiences that we shape ourselves, and so any life that we live isn't necessarily "false" (with this particular philosophy, I'd say that it'd be erroneous to predicate something like "our lives" with the words "true" or "false"; we simply live our lives, and that's that.)  But maybe, at least for some of us, since there's a nagging feeling in our heads about whether we did the right or wrong thing, that we can indeed talk about the "true" or "false" life, but in the context of morality; but what exactly is morality?  The Q&A cycle goes on and on from this point.

So the process is quite relentless and almost never ending (maybe when we tire of debating ourselves and others about various topics, we start drawing lines and say that, yes, <em>this</em> is exactly where my foundational beliefs are.)  But we question those as well, and see if we can get even further down and see if we were erroneous to even believe that our current belief system is even an accurate one.

Some of you might say, "of course we can establish a stance!"  But it seems to always be for the sake of debate, rather than for establishing a source of inspiration on how to view the world.  In light of that, how do we establish such a foundational stance that would last us for our entire lives?  Perhaps the answer does come from the gut, though sometimes, our gut is influenced by what goes on around us, which is further contingent on other factors in the past.  Perhaps we really should just bite the bullet and accept that any particular philosophy is okay, as long as he products of any actions produced by said philosophy are "useful" in some sense.

But really, I don't really have an answer at this time, but I have an inkling that the answer would generally come from continental philosophy; analytic philosophy has sort of showed me how to systematically tear apart arguments, but it seems to not do much in establishing any guidance on how one ought to live life.
