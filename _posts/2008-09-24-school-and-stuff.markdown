So yeah, I've posted my schedule back in May, and I've finally got all of my books.&nbsp; I started reading a few of my books (namely, linear programming and philosophy of language), both being pretty interesting.&nbsp; We'll see how the classes go, which start in... nine hours?<br /><br />Anyway, I'm also trying to look for a place for under $500 that's somewhat close to the UW, or at least next to a bus line that goes to the UW.&nbsp; There's a potential room that's open in the U-District that's exactly $500 per month which I'm going to be checking out this week.&nbsp; Hm, hopefully this whole job/school/put-all-of-my-paychecks-into-rent-and-not-into-food thing can be juggled successfully for someone who hasn't had to do such a thing ever in his life. :)<br /><br />And, note to self: never, ever talk about plans of changing jobs with coworkers.&nbsp; This may backfire pretty badly. :D<br />
