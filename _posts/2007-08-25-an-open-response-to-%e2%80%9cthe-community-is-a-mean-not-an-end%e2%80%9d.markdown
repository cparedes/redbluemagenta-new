For those who don't know, I used to be a part of the "community," where it is in general a group of people who, well, want to get laid.  Yeah, I know, it sounds really retarded, but at the time, it seemed like a good idea.  As you can imagine, most have inept social skills, some desperate, and all completely oblivious to the idiocy of the "community."  I mostly joined this "community" in order to improve my own social skills and not to "pick up women," though I found that the "community" was simply an example on ineptness rather than the glowing beacon that the people in the "community" claimed it was; in other words, it provided an easy reference point that exemplified what NOT to do in the future.  In any case, after leaving the "community," I've since become a lot more social and made a lot of good friends along the way.

The fallacy of thinking that something that must be experienced can be reduced down to bits of advice put into words is the basis of the community; the people in the community think that you can simply go around the obstacle of experiencing necessary events and growing pains in order to become more social and to "get laid," which, while it can at least give the illusion of it working, it is, in reality, a very unstable foundation.

Anyway, on to my response and reflection:

Being at peace with ourselves as a means to becoming more social is definitely something I agree with.  If we are uncomfortable with ourselves, we cannot be comfortable in any situation.  We must accept ourselves fully in order to present ourselves to others in the most genuine way possible.  Being social seems to come naturally as a corollary to being at peace with ourselves, though we also, in some cases, cannot ever be at peace until we throw ourselves into social situations and eventually learn to be at peace.

We should approach social situations as a means to get to genuinely know people rather than as a battleground where we have to deliver banter line here, neg there, etc. etc.  Everyone's got something to say, it's just a matter of prying it out of their heads and appreciating it, even if there's disagreement.

Here's where I disagree with the post: why try to be the fun guy (which, according to the post, is essential to making friends) when you can simply accept the fact that you can't be fun all the time?  Personally, I can have a lot of fun in various situations, but at other times, I speak my mind in a very serious manner and still be fine with everyone.  Maybe he's instead trying to hint at always having a positive attitude that lends to being fun, which I do agree with.

I'll wrap this up with the best piece of advice that many misunderstand and throw away: be yourself.  Yes, a lot of people in the community say that "being yourself" never worked for them and think, in some circles, that that is probably the WORST piece of advice that they can ever follow.  Well, my suggestion in this case if you can't follow the advice is to FIND yourself and to be more social.  Find "normal" people to talk to, those who are outside any subcultures or communities.
