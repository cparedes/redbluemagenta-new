Alright guys, I'm going to stop starting tomorrow (Wednesday).  Hopefully.  I already exhausted my set of cigarettes and plan on not hanging outside the Allegro as much, since all people do out there is smoke anyway.  But yeah, I figure this should be easy, I've only been doing it for around three weeks, so I doubt I'll get the nausea that people get after staying away for like six hours.

But in any case, I figure I should be good by Friday or so.  That should take care of all of the nicotine in my body.

Hopefully this goes well.
