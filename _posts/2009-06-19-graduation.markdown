I suppose I should write something about this topic.

These five years have been pretty awesome; I've learned a lot about many different subjects and developed a lot of appreciation for topics that I've never thought I'd be interested in.  For instance, I've learned to appreciate literature in different ways than I've ever imagined, from learning about the ties between "Frankenstein" and the movie "Blade Runner," to learning about (I think) the differences between an act (or duty?) and a wish, both with the novel "War and Peace" and with the lineup of films by Stanley Kubrick (I'll have to thank Willis Konick for that, he was probably one of my most favorite professors that I've had the pleasure of taking two classes from.)

My conception of what math was all about was thoroughly smashed apart by the time I got to my sophomore year as well.  And after that happened, my interest in it only increased.  I hadn't done all too well, but my interest has been fairly steady, and I think I wouldn't have been acquainted with the subject all too well if I hadn't forced myself to go through the classes.

I also thought that I wasn't all too interested in philosophy when I started taking it at the UW, though the logic and set theory classes sucked me in.  (When I started taking classes in philosophy, I had Leroy Searle's "Method, Imagination and Inquiry" in mind the entire time; I felt like I was left disappointed when I saw that most classes weren't about some sort of historical narrative when it came to stringing together the different philosophical positions in each class.)

But other than academic stuff, I've also learned a lot about myself and about the world around me.  I've probably changed the most as a person during these past five years and broke apart many misconceptions I've had about the world... sorta.  Well, I feel that I'm at least in a better spot when it comes to critically looking at my own position and other's positions and <em>maybe</em> coming to some sort of conclusion.  But overall, I've at least started experiencing the world in a much bigger way than I've ever had before.  I've met a lot of great people with friendships coming and going and had quite a few memorable experiences that I wouldn't trade with anything.

Overall, I've become a hell of a lot more curious about the world and I've started to temper myself into becoming a better person.  I think that's what's college is about: it's training us to become more curious about the world and develop ourselves into better citizens.  I don't think it's necessarily about getting ourselves into a career path, since all of us start on the bottom once we leave college; we learn to be <em>curious</em>, which opens us up for more learning.

Anyway, it's been a great five years, and I'm glad to be through with the whole damn thing.  Maybe graduate school will be in the horizon sometime soon...
