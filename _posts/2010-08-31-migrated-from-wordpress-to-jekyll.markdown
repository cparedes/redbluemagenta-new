Yay, so I've moved my blog from [Wordpress] to [Jekyll] in about a week.
It didn't take too long to port everything over, though I wanted categories,
comments, and pagination of something other than index.html.  Thus, I had
to do a bit of hacking on a Rakefile, adding in plugins here and there,
and also modifying a few scripts in order to export and import all of the
comments and categories from the Wordpress blog.  Now I'm satisfied; everything
is ported over (for the most part.)

If you guys wish to look at the code, it's over on my [GitHub] page.
