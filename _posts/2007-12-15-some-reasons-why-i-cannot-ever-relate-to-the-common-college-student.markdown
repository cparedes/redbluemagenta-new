I've found that I can't relate to college students in general.  I was talking to a few friends of mine who are outside of the college system (college graduated or not), and they all the same damn thing that I agree with: us college students have NO perspective.  We're sheltered.  We live in a fantasy land.

And here's another thing I can't vibe with either: most of the house parties I've went to have all been about social posturing and dominance more than anything rather than a bunch of chill people wanting to get to know everyone else (of course, in a party like that, that's almost expected, but I just have to say, it's getting tiresome meeting a bunch of people and forgetting who they are the next day.)

I'm sorry, I just can't do it anymore.  I love getting to know everyone else, just not the typical college student.  That's all.
