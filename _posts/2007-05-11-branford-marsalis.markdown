I saw him earlier this evening over at Jazz Alley here in Seattle.  He's doing stuff until Sunday, so if you guys just missed tonight's show, you guys definitely have more chances to check him out.

God damn, this was a great introduction to world class jazz performances; I've seen other jazz performances over at my university, but nothing like this.  His quartet was simply amazing and full of energy.

I'm thinking about convincing my dad and brother to take my mom over to Jazz Alley this Sunday for mother's day.

Anyway, yeah, I'm still fucking happy that I was able to finally see this dude in action!  A picture might be going up sometime in the near future of... Branford's signature ;p
