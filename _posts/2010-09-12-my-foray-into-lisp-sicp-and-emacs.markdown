So, after many jokes between me, my coworkers, and various friends, I've
finally decided to break down and learn emacs.  This is a bit after I decided
to learn a bit of material from [Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs], which uses Lisp as its primary programming language.

I'll first go over the history of what editors I've used over the years.

When I first started using Linux back in high school, it was quite hard for
me to wean myself away the Windows Way of doing things.  "You mean I have to
learn how to use the terminal?!?"  I did get away with just using **gedit**,
which was a comfortable text editor to use when I was in front of a Linux
machine with GNOME installed.

However, I eventually had to work on remote machines with no GUI at all, which
means I had to learn some sort of terminal text editor for me to be somewhat
productive.  Thus, the next easiest thing for me to use at the time was
**nano**.  It was very simple to adapt to, in the sense that I didn't have
to memorize a ton of different key combinations, nor did I have to figure out
how to insert text into a document.  I just typed stuff and it worked as
I expected it to.

I forgot exactly when I started using **vi(m)**, but I realized that I had to
learn it, since it's usually included by default on all UNIX systems.  It took
me a while to get used to the way vi(m) worked (*especially* alternating
between command mode and insert mode), and it took me a while to also figure
out that it was The Better Way compared to **nano**.  I became a bit more
fluent in it, and was able to edit files with a lot more ease than with
**nano**.

So anyway, I switched between **nvi** and **vim** for a while because I thought
BSD vi was a lot better, it didn't impose any stupid syntax highlighting rules
which didn't work half the time in vim, etc.

I've now just learned that **emacs** handles syntax highlighting *way* better
than vi(m).  Plus, it's easy to extend!  It's all in Lisp; I figure this is
a good way to sink my teeth into Lisp along with learning Lisp through SICP.

SICP is a great text by the way - I'm not through the first chapter quite yet,
but the problem sets seem to be both challenging and deep in its concepts
that it's trying to convey.  It's taking me a while to really understand how
Lisp works; there's a lot of "unlearning" I have to do in order to really
grok Lisp.

Anyway, that's really about it.  I heavily recommend SICP to anyone else
who's wanting a great introduction to programming and computer science.

I'm not quite sure yet if I would recommend emacs over vi(m) quite yet -
I don't want to incite a religious war. :)
