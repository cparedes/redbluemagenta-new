Here is my tentative plan: setup a VMWare private network with four or five virtual machines running at once.  I'll setup one OpenBSD firewall, one *BSD router/DNS server (not sure which BSD quite yet, probably OpenBSD), one FreeBSD mail server, one Solaris web server, and one Slackware NFS file server just for kicks.  I've also been writing up little bash, sed, and perl scripts at my current job in order to help sift through text files and spit back anything useful for either me or anyone else outside of the IT department.

After having a couple of brief forays into FreeBSD from a comfortable position in Linux, I still found myself at sea; there are enough things that are different in FreeBSD that can make it a little difficult to navigate at first.  I also figure that there are enough things that are different between Solaris and FreeBSD that would throw me off as well.  In any case, I want to get as close to the original Unixes as possible without breaking the bank (it's not like I can get my hands on an HP-UX server like magic.)  Solaris and FreeBSD might be the closest to the original UNIX source code as possible; Linux complies with POSIX standards but is simply a bastard child to UNIX at best.  Also, most of the BSD's (as far as I know) use csh or ksh as a default shell, and not bash (hell, I don't even think bash is even in the base system by default, it's probably a "port" at best.)

Anyway, that's all I have so far. :D
