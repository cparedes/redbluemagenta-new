After a few conversations with Phillip about the whole cat-recognition problem thing, I've decided to do a bit of reading in a book I bought a few weeks ago, as well as some light research on Wikipedia on computer vision.  Well, it didn't take long for me to hit upon a few helpful articles:

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-invariant_feature_transform">SIFT (Scale-invariant feature transform) Algorithm</a>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_of_Gaussians">Difference of Gaussians</a>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_recognition">Object Recognition</a>

The only problem is that when we are considering a live, breathing cat, we probably wouldn't see much of any clean linear transformations in the space we're working with (imagine a cat who curls up in a ball from a standing position.)  But there's still a lot more reading I have to do about this stuff before I can say any more about it...
