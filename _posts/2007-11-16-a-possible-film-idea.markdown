Me and a friend, both of us relative newcomers to Cafe Allegro, were thinking of making a few short clips of whatever conversations that we, along with others, have at Allegro.  Pretentious?  Yeah, maybe.  But we figure that it might be a great start in terms of documenting the sort of dynamic that we see at Allegro that is probably never seen at any other coffee shop, or perhaps anywhere else in Seattle.  And hell, we're also new to filmmaking in general, so this would be a great way to get ourselves acquainted with the whole thing.

I'm thinking that this could segue into making a full blown documentary that tracks maybe three or four of us and shows exactly how our individual days pan out, which then converge to conversation at Allegro.

In any case, there are a few outstanding problems that I'm kind of trying to resolve, like getting approval from the owner, how exactly we can introduce a camera to a spontaneous conversation without disrupting the flow, exactly WHAT camera we should use in order to achieve this goal (I was thinking camera phone, but that would be way too low quality to be effective, though it MIGHT work out somehow), how we should introduce a camera into the "Allegro sphere" without disrupting the flow of the entire coffee shop, maybe also how we can get people on board this project.  I figure the other guy that I was talking to is thinking the same thing, so we'll probably meet sometime again soon and discuss these problems further.

I can always check out a camera from Kane Hall at the UW, so that's taken care of, though of course that doesn't solve the problem of the camera making people nervous and whatever else.  We'll take care of it somehow.

I'm real excited about this whole thing, though we also have to approach the whole project with the right mindset.  I think approaching it in terms of making something BIG will totally dilute the film, so it'll be small and it'll have no other intentions other than to film spontaneous conversation.

Anyway, I hope it materializes.  I really want to do this.
