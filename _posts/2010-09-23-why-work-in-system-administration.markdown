I will admit right away: system administration is really not a sexy field
to be in, at least compared to the other technical fields out there.
However, I personally feel quite at home in system administration, and based
on my limited exposure so far, it can also be one of the most fulfilling fields
to work in.

The range of responsibilities may vary between teams and different companies,
but at its core, we manage multiple machines, whether they be hooked into a
network or not. Some departments employ sysadmins in order to not only look
over the network and systems of computers, but also to administer any other
device that hooks into a computing device, like a network printer, fax
machines, etc.  Other roles are far removed from the actual physical hardware,
to which the sysadmin takes more on a role of ensuring that such systems
of computers are actually doing what they're supposed to do (which is to
serve that website you always go to, or to let you login with your username
and password without compromising security, etc.)

But why work as a system administrator rather than as a software developer,
or as a lawyer, doctor, etc.?

The biggest reason that the field appeals to me is that I get to solve
interesting problems, day after day; it's awesome to solve issues involving
hundreds, or even thousands, of computers. It's a natural extension of the
knack that one gains when they're fixing a single computer - now
that you're working with hundreds/thousands of machines, you now have to think
about picking a solution that is tractable to deploy to a whole system of
computers.

The system administrator often keeps his nose as close to the particular inner
workings of a system, and thus, usually is the domain expert on weird issues
that happen with machines.  As of late, this knowledge is not necessarily
valued as much as it was before, but it's still ever more important - for
instance, when deploying things to EC2 or even bare metal, you need to know
how to measure IOPs, and you even need to know *why* you're measuring that in
the first place (maybe you're deploying an I/O intensive service?)  When
deploying services in the cloud, more often than not, you're working with
machines that are significantly underpowered compared to what you can get
as a bare metal machine; therefore, these weird things that you've been
learning about file system performance and whatever else suddenly become
important.

No matter what anyone says, the system administrator is, more often than
not, one of the most important roles in a company, especially when your company
is providing large amounts of computing resources for customers.  They are
the guys who both make sure your desktop is running smoothly, and make sure
that your high traffic website doesn't fall under the pressure of traffic,
nor under the pressure of system crackers.  They're responsible for all
computing resources, all the way up (but not necessarily including) the
application level, where the software developers thrive (I'm not saying that
software devs aren't concerned about system-level issues, it's just that it's
not usually their central focus point, and it's something that most devs
aren't responsible for in production environments.)

It's not sexy, but it's extremely fulfilling. I encourage everyone to take
a look at the field and see if it's for you.
