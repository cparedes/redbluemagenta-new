I usually get just enough aid for each quarter to cover tuition and like $100 or $200 worth of books each quarter.

However, I decided to go for summer quarter in order to actually do something productive during the summer.

The UW, however, decided that instead of offering more money to pay for tuition for summer through spring, they spread the whole thing out so that I have a $700 deficit that I have to pay out of pocket each quarter.

GAYED.

I will have to figure it out somehow.  Either that or become super smart so I get super smart scholarships to cover tuition.
