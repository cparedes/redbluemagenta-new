I'm fucking up again this quarter.

I haven't gone to any of my classes (except for my Tagalog class) for several weeks now, and I am scared about failing, about going back into class after not showing up for several weeks, about finding out how shitty my grades are after not receiving any of my midterms / quizzes back, etc.  In other words, I have absolutely no motivation whatsoever to sit in a lecture, take notes, take quizzes and tests, etc.

I feel that I've pissed away my chances of getting into graduate school, thanks to me failing a handful of classes last year, and getting just a passing grade (a 1.7 or a little above that) in a few others.

I'm all down and out about it, because I still have a lot of interest in math, but I feel that if I cannot even get a relevant job that would thrust me into a position where I can study it more, then I should just give up on the whole idea of academia in general.

ARGH.  And I'm stuck with $30,000 worth of debt!
