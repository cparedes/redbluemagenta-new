I've had an iPhone 3GS for roughly six months; I bought it second hand from my brother after owning a Nokia N900 for a while.  I was pretty disenchanted with the Maemo platform, especially with Nokia's run-ins with the [Osborne Effect] (for those who don't know, roughly one or two months after the N900 was released, Nokia announced that they were developing Maemo 6, which was then merged with the Moblin project in order to give birth to the MeeGo project.  They then announced that MeeGo was not to be supported officially on the N900.)

I love the iOS platform, don't get me wrong; the UI is quite polished and every behavior is consistent between every app, thanks to Apple's libraries and policies regarding UI design.  However, I was tired of not having a level of customization in an un-jailbroken phone as one would have on the Android platform, plus I was not happy with how notifications were handled, nor was I happy about the restrictions on iOS's multitasking abilities.  I had to cut costs somehow on my monthly bills as well, and after evaluating AT&T's exuberant costs for a 2 GB data plan along with unlimited texting and a decent amount of minutes, I decided that I need to hop on another provider who had much lower costs for data and texting (I don't care much for talking on the phone, so I don't really care how minutes I get in a mobile plan.)

I've heard about the Nexus S being released in December, so I decided to dive right in and buy the phone from Best Buy, along with switching over to T-Mobile.  T-Mobile, thankfully, offers a contract-free "Even More Plus" plan that costs only $60 per month for unlimited data (likely capped at 5 GB, which is then throttled for any usage beyond 5 GB), unlimited texting, and 500 minutes of voice.

After buying the Nexus S, the very first thing I've noticed was how graceful the notifications were handled on Android.  Every notification is stuffed in the notifications drawer on the top, which you can read at your own leisure.  The second thing I've noticed was that the UI wasn't really that bad at all - sure, there's a bit of inconsistency between each application, but you can be assured that the four buttons on the bottom of the phone will each consistently do what they suggest they do in every app.  In short, there's a lot of FUD about how terrible the UX/UI is in Android, and really, it's still all very easy to use.

The level of customization on the Android platform is amazing.  I've switched out the software keyboard with [SwiftKey], which I think is an awesome software keyboard for the Android.  Some people like [Swype].  Others like the plain old Android keyboard that comes stock on many phones.  The fact of the matter is, you're not stuck with one particular input method - you have the choice of switching out the keyboard, the home screen style, etc.  You have no such choice on iOS - you have to stick with everything Apple provides by default.

Android's integration with the whole suite of Google web applications is awesome, too.  Being able to use the default phonebook and be able to call out to any number with Google Voice by default is extremely helpful.  On iOS, I would've had to use yet another application which doesn't work so well as a default dialer.  Being able to check in with Google Latitude, integrating your list of contacts with GMail, etc. is handled very well on Android.

I haven't noticed any issues with the Android App Market at all.  In fact, as a consumer, it's pretty awesome being able to get games/applications at a much lower price than on Apple's App Store.  It integrates with Google Checkout, which isn't any harder to use than using your Apple ID.

My only complaints about Android have to do with device fragmentation and carrier restrictions, though I've mostly avoided the whole question by getting a Nexus S.  When I bought my Nexus S, there was buzz about dual core processor phones coming out for the Android platform, and sure enough, at CES, there were a whole slew of them announced.  Am I jealous?  Sure I am, even though my Nexus S is plenty powerful.  With the Android platform, there's always new devices being announced that are way better than the previous set of phones, which hinders device satisfaction quite a bit.  iPhone users don't have this issue, as there's only one line of phones that are released fairly predictably every year.

Even with the above in mind, I'm satisfied with the Nexus S and Android platform, even more so than the iPhone I've had for a little while.  It's shaping up to be a very strong competitor to Apple's iOS platform.
