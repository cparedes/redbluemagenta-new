If you're into installing stuff into your computer and if you're into music, then get this sound card ASAPASPAPAPSAP

It's fucking great.  I replaced the easily replaceable OPAMPs on the card with LM4562's from National Semiconductor and threw the card into my computer.  I use a set of Klipsch Promedia Ultra 5.1 speakers as well as a pair of Sennheiser eH350's.

As a quick overview of the features, you can use Dolby Headphone, Dolby Pro Logic IIx, DTS Neo:PC, Dolby Digital Live, DTS-Connect, and various other stuff.  There's a way better rundown of the features on the <a href="http://www.auzentech.com/site/products/x-meridian.php">Auzentech website</a>.

The sound quality on my speakers went up a bit, though I don't think I have a good enough ear for these sort of things.  For some reason, I think I'm limited by the speakers themselves; a lot of other people with very high end equipment on avsforum.com and various other forums said that they heard a HUGE jump in quality.

However, it's A LOT better on my headphones.  It sounds great without any sort of the Dolby Headphone stuff; the vocals are more airy and lifelike compared to my Audigy 2.  With Dolby Headphone on, it's almost scary how lifelike it sounds; Dolby Headphone basically emulates a surround sound system in a larger room.  This, in combination with the already airy and "out of head" sound of the vocals and the more detailed instrumentation, makes it sound like the artists are actually in front of me.

The only real problem is the price: ~$170-$190 at Newegg.com.

But yeah, buy the sound card if you're really into listening to music with good quality equipment.
