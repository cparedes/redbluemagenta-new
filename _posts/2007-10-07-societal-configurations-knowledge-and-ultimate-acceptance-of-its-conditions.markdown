I was talking to an Ethiopian friend of mine today about how people live their lives in certain societal ecologies; for instance, in his home country, it is typical and natural for an 18 year old son in an agricultural area to go out and build his hut, raise animals, plant seeds, get a wife, etc.  It is a very simple life that is characterized by the amounts of space he has between him and the next house, the sorts of worries and tribulations he must tend to, etc.  In an agricultural area, there are not many worries except to tend to these livestock and food items in order to sustain his family.

However, in an urban environment, everyone is stacked on top and around each other, everything is uniform, there are many more worries, etc.  The only way to survive is to separate from the family unit, but it is of no smooth natural consequence; rather, it is a sort of wrestling around with the idea of Darwinism in an urban context and trying to create a role not in the familial unit but under the tutelage of an overseer of a business.

These sorts of human-made environmental configurations lends itself to drastic societal differences; the countryside, at least in some areas perhaps, is producer based and is more family based due to the expansiveness and traditional "grandfathering" of the land.  The urban center is known for its density and restriction of movement; this lends itself to a more uniform and individualist societal configuration.  The urban center also offers more specialist jobs that is not directly associated with the survival of the family - that is, they are not producing directly for the family, but rather earning money and buying things from a shopping center - which leads to the uniformity and increase of education of the people occupying the city.  The city, mind you, was born out of the industrial revolution, which required specialist roles for a job that serves someone outside of the family unit, versus the more well-rounded roles of people living in an agricultural area that directly serves the family unit; in the latter case, the family has a stronger pull as the atomic unit of a society versus individuals, though the strength of the pull definitely varies between countries.

However, we, who are mostly born from the city, have to accept the fact that we are generally separated from everyone else, and that there is nothing we can do about it.  The combination of specialization, higher education, density of population, capitalism, etc. lends to separation, as mentioned before.

Here are two fairly insightful quotes by Murray Bookchin that I found on Wikipedia while searching for "social ecology," whose works I should probably should read sometime:

"The notion that man must dominate nature emerges directly from the domination of man by man… But it was not until organic community relations… dissolved into market relationships that the planet itself was reduced to a resource for exploitation. This centuries-long tendency finds its most exacerbating development in modern capitalism. Owing to its inherently competitive nature, bourgeois society not only pits humans against each other, it also pits the mass of humanity against the natural world. Just as men are converted into commodities, so every aspect of nature is converted into a commodity, a resource to be manufactured and merchandised wantonly."

"The plundering of the human spirit by the market place is paralleled by the plundering of the earth by capital."

Perhaps to solve the problem of the "plundering of the human spirit" is to find a community markedly different from the rest of the environment, however rare that may be.  I'm probably hinting at Café Allegro again, but well, the exchange of conversation with no other intention but to learn of the other person and to try capturing the essence of their humanity is probably exactly what we need to get ourselves back on track; throwing away dominion and power games will, hopefully, allow us to finally treat human interactions as it is rather than as capital.

Otherwise, we accept what we have and appreciate life without aspiring for something great, which also implies that we should not fear the crashing of ambitions.  The aspiration of something great is the capitalist trap.  However, as someone else that I've talked to said, we mix up Eastern Philosophies with Western nihilism, which is yet another trap that we have to avoid.  To go along with simply living without aspiration is nihilism, while appreciating everything without aspiration points toward (probably) Buddhism or Taoism.
