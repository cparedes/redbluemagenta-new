So, you're a college student either preparing to graduate and wish to work
in the "real world", or you've still got a bit of time left in college and
have the "real world" in mind the whole time (or at least have it in mind as
a second option if academia doesn't work for you.)  Let's assume you're wanting
to work in a field of your choice, and that you really want to make it a life
long career.

The biggest thing to keep in mind is that your degree ultimately does not
add up to much - it only stands in place for experience only if you *don't*
have experience to begin with.  So *never* assume that your degree, by itself,
will net you a cool job.  I can only really vouch for the tech industry,
but I can tell you that they only really like one type of person:
a smart person who can get stuff done ([thanks Joel Spolsky].)

(Full disclosure: I work in a field that is not even close to being a cognate
of any of the departments I graduated from, and so this might be different if
you're applying for a job that is a bona fide private industry job that can
be considered a cognate of what you've graduated with.)

So how do you get experience while in school?  (This is the biggest issue
that most graduates run into: they see entry level jobs with one or two year
experience requirements.)  The easiest way to do this is to just build cool
shit on the side.  The next easiest way is to take an internship, but those
are quite competitive - the first option isn't competitive upfront, but
you'll have to get whatever you've built seen by the public somehow, which
*is* competitive in a sense.  Finally, you can just get a part time job,
but if you're looking to work in a very specific field, get a job that either
lets you work on that stuff on the side (that is, get a job that's flexible),
or that lets you work on that stuff on the job itself.  Anything else is a
waste of time.

How do you pick something that you'll want to do as a career?  Look at your
current hobbies.  See if you can market it somehow to the general public, or
see if people are doing somewhat the same thing as what you're doing as a
hobby.  There, now you have a career.  Now the tough part is keeping it as
a hobby/interest while you work in that field. :)

But alas, I'm sure most of you *do* have experience, but still have trouble
finding a job.  Here's the kicker: try to limit the amount of resumes you
blast out to employers, and make sure you craft a decent cover letter that
shows that you're a human being.  No, don't craft a cover letter that sounds
impressive, **craft a letter that makes you look like you still have a soul.**
Further, **be as honest as possible.**  I truly believe that honesty is, in
fact, one of the most pragmatic virtues a person can adopt (and I must thank
Garrett Cobarr, my parents, and many other people for showing me the way.)
Being honest on your resum&eacute; and on your cover letter helps you in
many more ways than one: it keeps the entire application's integrity intact,
and it shows that you, the applicant, have a lot of personal integrity.
This counts for a lot when applying for jobs.  What also counts for a lot is
a lot of passion, which again, is why I recommend taking a look at your
hobbies and see if you can make a living off of it.

I've been on the other side of the interview table maybe once early on in
my career, and it was astounding how much bullshit resum&eacute;s we received
in our inboxes. It may seem impressive to list random acronyms and to stretch
your experience a bit, but when doing phone screens and in person interviews,
these things get blown apart quite quickly if you haven't been totally
forthright on your application.  However, it *is* indeed tough to figure out
how to talk about your experience, especially early in your career; which,
I think it's still important why you should be as honest as possible.  This
requires a lot of self-reflection in order to figure out where your skills
are actually at.

Phew, this became a much longer blog post than usual. I'm still learning
a lot of this stuff as I go along, and please do correct me in various parts
if I'm totally off in my advice.  A lot of these things have worked for me,
but it may not work for everyone.
