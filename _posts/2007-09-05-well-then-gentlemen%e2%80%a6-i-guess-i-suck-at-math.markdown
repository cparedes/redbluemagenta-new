I got a 0.0 GPA in my Topology class.  EXCELLENT!!!!

I at least learned A LOT about how to actually prove shit and a lot of stuff about topology in general.  It was my first real intensive math class that I've had since I've transferred to the UW (the other two introductory to real analysis courses, 327 and 328, were intensive as well, but the professors weren't nearly as anal about how to construct proofs from first principles, not to mention that I didn't have to rewrite assignments five times over.)  The 400 level class I took at Seattle University (Abstract Algebra I) didn't even give me a taste on how much of an ass kicking I would receive in this class.

In any case, I guess I have to lay off the Allegro for a bit during the school year and actually use my time effectively.
