<p>A friend of mine was talking to me about a lecture that a visiting professor gave at the UW (or somewhere close by) a while ago, and that he proclaimed that &quot;language is fiction.&quot;</p>  <p>This blew my mind.&#160; Language, fiction?!&#160; Made up?&#160; But then, when we think of metaphors and the ways we try to cognate words to attach to meanings, as well as the way we fool around with language in order to mean something else with the same set of words, or perhaps attaching new meanings to words, etc., we see that this might indeed be an illuminating statement.&#160; I personally don't know much about the motivators behind the phrase nor do I know enough about literature nor philosophy to really comment on it, but it seems to be at least a great starting point for my own inquiry into the topic.</p>  <p>My friend also said that the professor gave a really nice and brief example: if this statement is true, then what is the difference between a laundry list and a poem?&#160; Answer: one doesn't pretend to be fiction.</p>  <p>Awesome.&#160; Anyway, I need to talk to this guy again and maybe get a good set of reading materials that might help to clarify the statement a bit more.</p>
