This might sound bizarre to a lot of people who are in IT; after all, our primary job title dictates what our primary goals are.  A DBA makes sure that the databases are up and running, a systems administrator makes sure that the systems are up and running, and a security engineer makes sure that the systems are running as securely as possible, and that the processes in a company involving computing services keep IT security in mind.

But we often forget <em>why</em> we're doing what we're doing.  Yes, the systems must be up and running and everything has to be well oiled, but we do not do it for the sake of doing it, but we do it because we have customers who require computing services to be up and running.  Not only that, but we have a greater responsibility in the community to make sure that we're providing a computing environment that lets people get their work done.

Of course, there's mandates and various things we would have to comply with: for instance, if we work in any health related industry, we'd have to comply with HIPAA.  But otherwise, why put the users through all sorts of hoops?

Some IT admins might have a tendency to lock down the computers as much as possible and only allow certain programs to be installed.  I say, give them admin access to their computers and allow your infrastructure to be flexible and not rigid (that is, you'd have to account for any environmental factors in your infrastructure, rather than shield everything away from the environment.)  This may mean more work for you to block against any sort of foreign agent (viruses, spyware, etc.), but ultimately, it would be for the user's benefit.  I'd say that if you force yourself to think in these parameters, you'll start thinking about solutions that are as transparant as possible to the user, which is a huge net win for the users and for you.

Too many times have I seen deployments where the computers are as locked down as possible from any sort of user intervention; it was impossible for anyone to get anything done, and it was impossible for anyone to "personalize" their computer in any sort of way.  "They should do that on their home machine," you might say.  But you might also be directly responsible for any sort of ill will against your department and maybe even for overall morale in the company . . .
