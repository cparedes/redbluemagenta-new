I saw this picture in a Facebook group called "Larouche Kids Need Therapy" just now:

<a href='http://blog.redbluemagenta.com/2007/11/20/the-genius-of-larouche/larouche-math/' rel='attachment wp-att-152' title='LaRouche Math'><img src='http://blog.redbluemagenta.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/n10708173_32113371_925.thumbnail.jpg' alt='LaRouche Math' /></a>

Side note: I shamefully talked to one of these LaRouche kids a couple of months ago, and while I was trying to say something about logic in terms of how mathematicians use logic to come up with a^2 + b^2 = c^2, a nappy haired girl popped up in front of me and eloquently hinted that, yes, rapists use logic.
