For those who don't know, Radiohead is releasing their new album, "<a href="http://www.inrainbows.com/Store/Quickindex.html">In Rainbows</a>," on the internet.  They are offering both a box set for 40 pounds (which is equivalent to $80+, though it comes with two vinyl LPs, two CD's with one having extra songs that isn't included in the digital download as well as other stuff) and a digital download for... whatever price you wish to put on it.  Awesome deal, though I'm sure most people will put either 0 pounds or the least amount of money that it would take to get the entire album.

I myself am putting in 0.5 pounds in for the album because I'm fucking cheap.

This should be an amazing album.
