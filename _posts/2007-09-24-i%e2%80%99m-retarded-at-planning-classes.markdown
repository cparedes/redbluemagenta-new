Okay, look at this <a href="http://students.washington.edu/jkivligh/uwroutes/map.cgi?speed=133.259131745&points=1999.9187499999998%2C2027.4301369863012%7C2200.1812499999996%2C1716.1424657534246%7C1028.375%2C1196.427397260274%7C1859.19375%2C866.1917808219177">route map</a> between my classes on Wednesday and Friday.

Anderson to Electrical Engineering... okay, that's good.  Then Electrical Engineering to Condon within 10 minutes?!  Then Condon to Denny?
