Terence Tao is an extremely important mathematician who has worked on I believe harmonic analysis and number theory, and is also the youngest recipient of the Fields Medal (which is basically the equivalent of a Nobel Prize, except it is only awarded to mathematicians under the age of 40) and a MacArthur Fellowship.

In any case, he's apparently giving a lecture each day for three days at the UW Physics/Astronomy Auditorium, starting tomorrow afternoon.  If you live in Seattle and are remotely interested in math, I encourage you to attend at least one of these lectures.
