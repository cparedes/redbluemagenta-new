We are at awe when we are born.  Imagine the light flooding into our eyes as we open them for the first time; our wonder at the world as it exists rather than what is constructed through presuppositions; and the lack of memory when moments are fleeting, the future impermanent.

As time goes on, our memories are developed and we develop ourselves within a societal construct.  We presuppose meanings through prior experiences and things that are told to us through metaphors and song.  Instead of being at awe, we at once understand and thus, our curiosity wanes as our appetite for knowledge is quenched.

Our lenses in which we view the world are stained as time goes on.  We assume certain truths and base our knowledge off of that, rather than being at awe and viewing the world in wonder.  We start to then ask more complicated questions, things that go toward the core of our existence or the core of an object's existence rather than questioning the object as it exists in the world.

Perhaps when we now turn our heads toward philosophy, we have ceased to be child-like; that's why I don't like analytic philosophy.  To me, it ceases to be in awe of the world and tries to kill curiosity.  Perhaps even the quest for truth seems to be fruitless as it implies that we are trying to squelch curiosity of the mysterious force in front of us.  I'm thinking that destroying any notion of truth seeking and rather simply wonder at the beauty of the world will at least restore our humanity in a culture that seems to be devoid of wonder and humanity.
