So, I've been thinking about what I should possibly do after I graduate.  I'm hoping that I can get a full time entry level / junior level position in IT, but the job market is looking real terrible right now.  I was also thinking about graduate school, maybe in something like statistics.  But how everything will line up, I don't know. . .

One possible choice is to work a little bit in IT for a year, apply to graduate school, and get a masters degree in, say, statistics.  Another possible choice is to simply go right into IT and just stay there until I turn blue in the face.  It's just the graduate school part that's a little distressing for me; my grades simply suck and I don't know if any department around here in Seattle would want to take me in.  My set theory professor suggested that I talk to the statistics department here, but the only problem is that I don't have demonstrable probability and statistics skills (I've never bothered to take MATH 394 / 395 at all, and I'm starting to realize how much of a mistake that was.)  An acquaintance suggested that I check out the engineering disciplines, as they apparently are in want of people with a decent math background with no prior engineering experience required.

I think, maybe, it was a good thing that I didn't apply to grad school yet.  I could use a break in order to sort everything out in my head. . .
