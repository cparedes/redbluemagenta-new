<p>I replaced LING 200 with LING 400, which is, &quot;Survey of Linguistic Method and Theory.&quot;&#160; SO... now my schedule looks like this:</p>  <p>LING 400: M-Th   <br />PHIL 320: TTh    <br />CHID 498: MW</p>  <p>Total: 12 credits</p>  <p>Not bad, I'd say... I'm just looking for one more class to round everything up.</p>
