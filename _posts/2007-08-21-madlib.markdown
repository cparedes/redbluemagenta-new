Just found out that Madlib has a new album coming out called "Beat Konducta Vol 3-4: In India," where he samples everything from Indian movies (and songs too?!?)  He has a bunch of his stuff on <a href="http://www.myspace.com/madlib">myspace.com/madlib</a>, including a trailer which I think is FUCKING INCREDIBLE.

... oh yeah, it's leaked on the internets. :>
