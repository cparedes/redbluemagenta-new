I finally went into MATH 301 (Elem. Number Theory) for the first time today.

It sucked.  No proofs, it's all simple calculations.  And Koblitz was easily the worst professor I've had for the thirty minutes I managed to stay in the class.

Needless to say, I dropped the class right after I left.

I'll probably just take the Number Theory topics class when it comes up in Spring Quarter.

In other news, the huge black box with the camera that I picked up from classroom support services today weighs more than my head.  More on this later.
