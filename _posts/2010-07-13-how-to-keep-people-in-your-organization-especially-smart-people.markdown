When an organization says outright that they only hire smart people, I'd love to believe that they're telling the truth (they might actually believe this to be true.)  However, I've found out that an organization must put its money where its mouth is when it comes to actually <em>keeping</em> them on staff.

### 1. Smart people want to be recognized, not necessarily with money.

More often than not in <em>company-that-shall-not-be-named</em>, whenever someone did <em>anything</em> remotely beneficial, the managers would not recognize how much effort and time was sunk into that specific problem.  Yes, there is a lot of satisfaction from solving technical problems, but I believe that actually <em>knowing</em> that you've done a decent job goes a long way.  In fact, in this same company, the joke was that there was only a "once a year praise quota."  This is bad.

They tried to make up for this by giving healthy amount of bonuses at the end of the year, along with opportunities to earn money if one goes to company outings.  I don't know about you, but I don't buy my friends, and I don't especially care about bonuses; I care more about making friends outside of any monetary incentive and how invested I am in the work I do.

### 2. The workload must not make the person feel like Sisyphus.  Corollary: there must be a drive in the organization to actually improve the workload.

In the same company, there was almost no encouragement nor opportunity to actually get rid of the interrupt driven tickets.  Any sort of improvement in the infrastructure was only dealt with by the managers, and so the rest of us would have to only deal with the same tickets, day after day.  After three months, I only started to actually understand the infrastructure, to which I suggested that I take on a major project to get a working installation of Puppet up and running: this idea was killed on the spot.

### 3. Smart people need direction, too.

There's no way for anyone to figure out what's going on by themselves, when they have to not only figure out how the infrastructure is strung together, but also figure out the institutional memory behind the infrastructure as well.  When given no direction, there's no way anyone's going to figure out both aspects of the infrastructure within a given time frame, unless you give them a project that gives both direction and an opportunity to ask pointed questions about the infrastructure.

### 4. Communication is great (in moderation.)

At <em>the-company-that-shall-not-be-named</em>, there was almost no communication: everyone was left to their own devices, lots of work was duplicated, and when there was any sort of communication, it was all about showing how much more ego one has over the other person.

At another company, there was <em>too much</em> communication, to the point where anything must be vetted by committee, thus creating an environment that stymied any sort of initiative.

I believe the best middle ground is having a workflow based off of the Agile approach: there's a quick ten minute meeting every week where everyone reports on what they're working on and how far they've gotten, and everything is sketched out based on two/three week sprints.

But most importantly, I believe maintaining professional respect for the other party is important; let all parties know what's going on, no matter how good or bad the news is.  The Agile methodology is not necessarily the cure-all for all of your ills.

Anyway, that's all I have to say about the topic.  I wish said company well, but they have a long ways to go toward actually retaining their supposed talent.  I hope that if you're running a business, that you try not to fall into the same trap as <em>the-company-that-shall-not-be-named</em>.
