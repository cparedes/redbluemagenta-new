I think I have a bit of a better grasp at the sort of culture issues that we minorities face all of the time.&nbsp; I've just finished <u>Disoriented</u> and <u>The Debut</u> just a minute ago, and a lot of it strongly resonates with me, especially the little bits and pieces of family life that I can definitely relate to.&nbsp; On the other hand, there's also a lot that I can't relate to at all, since the environment that I've grown up in was totally opposite to what went on in the movies; I lived in a mostly white neighborhood with pretty much no Filipinos who were even close to the Filipinos in <u>The Debut</u>.&nbsp; That, and my extended family, at least on my mom's side, are already Americanized to such a high degree that I haven't really experienced family reunions that were "Filipino" through and through.<br /><br />Our mother culture slips away as more and more generations are born within a "foreign" country.&nbsp; With this in mind, it's important to retain a sense of our culture and to appreciate the struggles that our parents have been through in order to put us here in America.<br /><br />However, how can we retain our culture without dividing our own community?&nbsp; There's a lot of inner community tension in both movies, which, unfortunately, accurately reflects the inner community tension experienced in today's Filipino-American community.&nbsp; There's the new immigrants, the first generation Filipinos and the second / third / fourth / etc. generation Filipinos.&nbsp; It's divided even further depending on how close in touch one might be with either the Filipino culture or the, well, stereotypical Filipino-American culture where being thugged out is the way to fit in.<br /><br />I'm personally slipping away from all of this and am perhaps just one more Filipino-American who recedes the culture to the background.&nbsp; But I know this is probably the worst way to deal with this sort of tension and that I should, at the least, learn as much as I can about my own mother culture before I scurry away from all of the cultural conflicts within the community.<br /><br />I don't know though.&nbsp; The movies, while at times over the top and unrealistic (at least in relation to my own experience here in Seattle), brought these cultural issues further toward the foreground, and maybe that's enough for me to start doing something about it, starting with my own education of my own culture, then maybe we'll see from there whether I should keep running away from the community or not.<br />
