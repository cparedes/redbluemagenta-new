The value of documentation and formal processes rears its ugly head right when we forget what we did six months ago, and when we have to pass knowledge over to any other person in the company.

They seem to have no value otherwise, especially if "everyone knows" that a process has always been done a certain way in the company, or when you're the only person in the department who has to do a certain function that no one else does.  Unfortunately, a process might seem intuitive to one person, but for the next person who will either assist or replace you, it will not be intuitive at all for them (they would have to figure out what you take for granted.  This would not be easy to uncover.)  In fact, I'd wager that said process will become unintuitive for <em>you</em> in six months, granted that you end up moving on to other projects or other roles.

The biggest warning sign that should hint toward creating an up to date documentation store is if you have to go to a specific person for a specific piece of information that is needed for <em>you</em> to get things done.  Information within an organization should, for the most part, be documented, which serves two purposes: 1. to cover your ass, and 2. to make sure that if anyone else needs to do what you used to do, then they can do it (think of it this way: you can also move on to bigger and better projects without having to remember a bunch of things about other projects.  But as I hinted at in the last blog post, do your other coworkers a favor and automate the things you've just documented, or have them automate it for you.)

Further, having a well documented process that everyone follows will both make sure that the process is done consistently, and will allow you to automate the procedure once it's written down and well understood.

Lastly, having a ton of documentation is not just for big, lumbering enterprises.  In fact, it's likely you'll be wearing many hats at a smaller organization, and it's crucial that you're able to reproduce your work consistently when you're doing one task in a specific role, and then switch over to another role and do another task consistently as well.  So write down everything that you've done for a project, write down the steps while troubleshooting various issues in deployment and maintenance, and after you're done writing these things down, try to write automated tasks so that you don't have to worry about doing those things that you've just written down (if the automation breaks, you'll know where it breaks down since you've written out how to fix the service manually . . . right?)
