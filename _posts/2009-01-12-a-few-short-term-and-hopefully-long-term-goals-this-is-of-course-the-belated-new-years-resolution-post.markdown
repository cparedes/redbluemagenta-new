So, after reading a friend's blog, I got to thinking about what sort of stuff I should probably set for myself in the short term, which hopefully will turn into long term habits.

One of these things is appropriately budgeting my money.  Okay, so I'm still in college, and I don't have to pay my loans (yet), so the highest priority expenditures have yet to incorporate anything more than simply rent, utilities, and groceries.  Fair enough.  I don't spend all too much on groceries, maybe ten dollars per week at the most, and my rent is real cheap as well (though it is doubling in a little over a week from now since I'm moving soon with Sara), so my income minus these highest priority expenditures equals a fairly high disposable income.  However, my current "luxurious expenditures" are pretty damn high.  For instance, I buy coffee at least twice a day (only a double shot espresso, which is about $2.00 per cup), but I also buy chips (~$1.25), an energy drink (~$2.50), and a cookie (~$1.50).  Yeah, I buy chips and cookies every day because I'm way too lazy to prepare my own food ahead of time.

So that equals about $10 per day.  I spend almost nothing during the weekend, so in the seven days in a week, that's already $50 per week.  That, and I buy a pack of cigarettes once every three days, so that's about an extra $10-$15 per week.  $60-$65 total.  Shit.

So here is my plan: if I absolutely need to keep myself awake, I'll make coffee in my house and put it into my Thermos before I head out.  While I'm doing that, I should prepare breakfast and pack whatever is left over for the entire day.  I should buy groceries instead of eating crap from deli's and coffee shops.

I'll need to get myself to stop smoking as well, though I REALLY REALLY need a compelling reason in order to get myself to stop.  So far, I haven't stumbled upon such a compelling reason, so that's something I'd have to work on as well.

More time needs to be allocated to sitting down and reading my assigned readings, as well.  I'm finding out more and more that the current dogma of philosophy is real hard to swallow, but well, fuck, I need to actually get decent grades for the final two quarters of my college career.

Anyway, that's about it. :O
