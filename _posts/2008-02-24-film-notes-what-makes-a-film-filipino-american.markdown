<p>Or perhaps to generalize the question, what makes a piece of work more ethnically inclined in America than, say, a piece of work by a white American?&#160; And what minimal elements of the culture must be explicitly dealt with in the work in order for it to be &quot;Filipino-American?&quot;</p>  <p>These questions underline what Roger, Aaron and I are trying to address in our short films, though the questions and answers aren't necessarily obvious from a first or second viewing of any of our potential films nor any other Filipino-American film that I've watched to date.</p>  <p>I figure that a good portion of the cultural issues that are present in the Filipino-American communities around the United States have to do with the loss of Filipino culture to the mainstream American culture, mostly through the loss of the appreciation of &quot;old&quot; Filipino culture from one generation to the next.&#160; I was talking to someone earlier tonight about this issue, and he made a good point that I've known myself for a while, though it's been kept somewhere in the back of my head for a long time: Filipinos tend to be more invisible and less proud of their own culture, because Filipinos are so enamored by American culture (perhaps due to the &quot;colonization&quot; of the Philippines by America in the early 20th century) and is thus more willing to throw away the culture in favor for American products and sensibilities.&#160; Fortunately, the eventual loss of culture is recognized as a problem, yet the ensuing reaction to this problem has also created another problem: divisions within the community.&#160; Can one call themselves Filipino if they are entrenched in American culture?&#160; Perhaps we Filipino-Americans have created a false dichotomy between us and the rest of America, and that we should simply throw away these questions and simply appreciate what we have.&#160; But, of course when we do that, we cease to be critical of what's being pulled out of our culture, and we in turn become complacent and start to forget our history, which causes Filipino culture to become even more invisible and irrelevant.</p>  <p>To try to answer the first question, I'm quite convinced that for a film to be &quot;Filipino-American,&quot; it must deal with a certain set of issues that are somewhat visible to the public.&#160; I'll be honest, most if not all Filipino-American culture is invisible to the general public, so it must be illuminated explicitly; however, while typing this, it just occurred to me that for an African-American film to be African-American, it had better include bits and pieces of African-American culture in the film, else it will be just a typical garden variety film.&#160; But what about racial sensibilities that have the potential to come out when directing a film?&#160; Perhaps our sensibilities will come out and display themselves on film through any sort of subconscious decisions in editing and filming; but then again, if say we're talking about Filipino-American directors, who have of course experienced around the same sort of troubles with their identity as the next Filipino-American, we could also expect some sort of identity conflict and struggle to even make visible any sort of sensibilities that the director might have.&#160; So I figure that since Filipino-American culture is considerably more invisible than African-American culture, not to mention the existence of a widespread identity crisis that would befuddle the sensibilities of the director in question, the filmmaker must explicitly deal with a few stereotypes or issues rather than assume a base knowledge that the viewer might have about the issues or culture.</p>  <p>What I've written up above seems to have opened up a few cans of worms (for me at least) that I'll need time to clarify: one problem to tackle would be the &quot;identity crisis&quot; and how it relates to clarifying one's discourse on Filipino-American issues (clarifying in the sense that we ought to clarify our identity before we talk about issues like &quot;invisibility&quot; and the like.)&#160; These new problems will be dealt with later.</p>
