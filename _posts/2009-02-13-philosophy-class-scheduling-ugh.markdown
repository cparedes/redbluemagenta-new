So, for next quarter, I have to take Intro to Logic, a 400 level course, a philosophy elective, and Tagalog.  Okay, cool, so I saw that there was an Axiomatic Set Theory course offered next quarter, a Philosophy of Kant course, and I just found out that there is a Philosophy of Math course as well.  Cool, those ALL sound super interesting, except that the first two courses are at the same exact time on the same exact days, while taking Phil. of Math would conflict with both Logic and Tagalog (yes, out of all of the three or four sections of Logic, NONE of them work with Phil. of Math and Tagalog).

This happened this quarter as well, though I forgot exactly which courses I was thinking of taking.  I ended up in Epistemology and Intro. to Metaphysics eventually, and I can't say I enjoy either of them as much as I thought I would. :(

At least the math department knew that people would want to take, say, Fundamentals of Analysis, Algebra, Topology, maybe some sort of special topics course, etc. all in the same quarter, so they actually schedule them at different times on different days from each other.  Philosophy, on the other hand, is a fucking mess.
