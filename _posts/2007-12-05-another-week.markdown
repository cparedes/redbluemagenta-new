It's been one week since I've last had contact with my ex.

It's still tough.  Really tough.  I don't mind not dating her anymore, but to not be able to be friends seems to drive the final nail in the grave.

I still have pictures on my computer that remind me too much of her.  I don't look at them explicitly, but when I'm scanning through my pictures, I always see them.

Anyway, dating around seems to be the best way to get my mind off of her.
