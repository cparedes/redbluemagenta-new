This is mostly for my own knowledge, and probably not for hardcore scientific applications.  Why am I asking this question in the first place, then?  Because I'm trying to figure out whether it's worthwhile in maybe building a super cheap (and hopefully low power) Beowulf cluster to run at home in order to learn more about the nuances of such a configuration.  I've been reading an ebook on the motivations behind building such a beast in the first place, and though of course it helps enormously in running scientific data through the cluster, I'm largely untrained when it comes to any sort of science.

So... what the hell can I do with a (hobbyist) Beowulf cluster?
