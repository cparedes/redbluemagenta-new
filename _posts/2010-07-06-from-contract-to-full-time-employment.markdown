So, before I interviewed with <a href="http://www.jambool.com">Jambool</a>, I interviewed with <a href="http://www.3tier.com">3TIER</a>, who provides information services for alternative energy companies.  I've heard from them just recently, and they've offered me a permanent full time position.

This fits well with the timing of the end of my contract: Jambool is an <em>excellent</em> place to work at, and I've learned a lot from my boss, <a href="http://entropystream.net">Benjamin Krueger</a>, and have had a great time in a great environment (I would go as far to say that I'm honored to have worked with such talent; they are, without a doubt, some of the best people in the industry.)

Cheers, Jambool: I wish you guys well in your venture.

However, I also couldn't pass on a great opportunity to work as a part of an industry that aims to provide solid alternatives to big oil, especially with what's going on these days in the Gulf of Mexico.  Further, I'll again have an opportunity to administer high performance compute clusters, something that I enjoyed administering back at the University of Washington.

Again, I had a great time at Jambool and I knew, after working there for a month, that I'd really enjoy working there for quite a long time.

It was a tough decision, and unfortunately, the decision came down to simple economics: do I want medical benefits and a stable income, or should I rely solely on contract work?  I suppose it depends from person to person, but for me, at this point in time, I need stable, full-time employment so I can pay off these damned student loans as fast as possible.

Anyway, I'm thinking that once I gain more experience and get my student loans mostly paid off, I can venture back into startup world and see what the waters look like once I'm ready to jump back in. :)
