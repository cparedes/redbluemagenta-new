As you all probably know, I've been meaning to work at Café Allegro for a while.  I've turned in my resumé earlier this week as a sort of reaction to the current job I'm doing at Computing & Communications at the UW; it's a decent job, I just simply cannot stand the environment.  In any case, I've heard from the grapevine that Nathaniel (the owner) either does not look at the resumés or he simply skims through them but prefers to talk to potential applicants face to face.

In any case, I've been meaning to talk to Nathaniel for a while, but since he usually only works morning shifts, I rarely, if ever, get to catch him before he leaves.  However, I lucked out a few days ago: I was hanging out outside of the coffee shop with coffee in hand when Nathaniel shows up from wherever he came from.  I stood up and told him that I submitted my application and that I wanted to talk to him about me possibly working in the coffee shop.  We sat down on the bench and dived into what was to be one of the best and quite possibly the most humbling conversations that I've had so far.  I've found out from our conversation that he has a very humble perspective on life.  He relates to anyone and everyone that walks around the area, basks in the precious moment that he has when talking to others, and relishes it as if it was the only gold nugget that he had ever set eyes on.  He realizes that everyone does their own thing and that we should simply accept it as how it is, even if they're in a hurry and doesn't like conversation (which is an example that I brought up in our talk).  His coffee shop is his most prized possession, with the cracked ground laid in front with cigarette butts strung all over the place being his sacred ground; the "parlor" in front of the cashier and barista being his living room; the conversations, his currency.

He mentioned that he tries to follow Taoism himself, which seems to make a lot of sense, now that I think about it.  He told me of a book he read about a potential business mogul who fell from grace and lost everything that he had owned, as well as had to accept the fact that he would be in poverty for the rest of his life.  However, he ended up finding joy in sweeping the street in front of a certain store for his entire life, doing the same routine every day, even if it irritated the customers inside of the store.  But he thought of nothing else but the task at hand, because that's all that was important at that moment.

Accepting whatever is at hand and treasuring every moment is something that I'm still working on, but is what Nathaniel has already seemingly mastered.

Anyway, I took an early lunch break today in order to see if I could catch Nathaniel and see if he thought about giving me a job.  He hasn't really thought about it much, since there were returning baristas who had greater priority than new applicants, which is no problem at all.

I then asked him if he calls applicants to tell them if they got the job or not.

"No, I usually don't.  It's all happenstance."
