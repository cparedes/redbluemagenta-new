Okay, so I'm not even that far in the book (in fact, I'm still on chapter one, trying to clear every problem before reading the next chapter), but holy shit, what a hell of a first chapter.  Everything is lucid, the proofs of the theorems in the readings are clear, and most of all, the problem set is DIFFICULT, but also not impossible and is rich in its pedagogy.  It took me something like three hours to finally crack a problem where I had to prove that there is a unique x such that b^x = y (the old familiar base-b exponential function) without using any calculus whatsoever, but plain set theory, field axioms, and the bare minimum real number line properties (most importantly, the least upper bound property).  Everything is built from the ground up, though not in the extreme sense in terms of defining the natural numbers in terms of sets or whatever weird shit I sometimes hear about.

But yeah, I'm already loving the textbook.  Here's hoping the rest of the book is like the first chapter.
