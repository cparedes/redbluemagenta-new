About three months ago, I posted <a href="http://robotdoves.blogspot.com/2008/08/welcome-back-my-good-friend.html">a comment</a> on <a href="http://robotdoves.blogspot.com">a feminist blog</a>, which, I'll concede, is a bit too blunt and perhaps uninformed comment about feminism.  Then just recently, they posted <a href="http://robotdoves.blogspot.com/2008/12/anit-intellectual-feminist-movement.html">a response to my comment</a> on their blog.  First, here is what I said:
<blockquote>i think, in my opinion, why people cannot take most feminist views with any seriousness is because (to me) it's EXTREMELY anti-intellectual. to put it even more bluntly, a lot of what's being said on behalf of feminism sounds like a lot of whining, not well thought out argumentation.  i personally can't take any position seriously when logic is replaced with pure passion and citations from "authority."</blockquote>
I will break down their response into smaller chunks and response to each chunk with as much "laughable argumentation" as possible (I guess.)

First,
<blockquote>Why separate your mind and heart? Why not have an emotional concern about what intellectual thought your mind takes in?

The problem with the theory "emotions inhibits logic" is that it just doesn't make sense. There is nothing wrong with embracing your emotions, living life with pure passion. Try it sometime, it might bring some good and less awkwardness that may have in the past require you to lean on <a href="http://www.neilstrauss.com/">Neil Strauss </a>to teach you social dynamics between men and women (and this is said cause I know a little something something about who wrote the comment..hehe) Neil Strauss, that is, who believed self fulfillment is achieved when you have complete control over your interactions with
women. Neil Strauss. .. I should do a post on him since apparently his tv show is still played.</blockquote>
I don't agree with the duality of emotions and logic myself, though I am unsure as to whether there is research actually showing that they might be inseparable.  Marvin Minsky suggests in <em>The Emotion Machine </em>that emotions are simply different ways of thinking, with "reason" being simply an emotion.  However (and yes, this is a dogmatic point of view), I believe that education can help us train ourselves in order to just simply get to the point and argue with novel premises, rather than devolve into a sort of screaming match.  There's NOTHING wrong with living life with passion, but what the hell does that have to do with, say, providing good argumentation?  Is being clear with our arguments analogous to living a cold, heartless life?  What the fuck?

Also, the ad hominems will be dismissed, but I do want to clarify something about Mr. Neil Strauss: he is a fucking idiot.  Why?  Because his commentary on the interactions of men and women is backed up by nothing, and well, on the practical side of things, he's steadily losing clout over many of his followers, for most people are starting to realize how much bullshit he really stuffed in the minds of people.  I point the reader to <a href="http://blog.redbluemagenta.com/2007/08/25/an-open-response-to-“the-community-is-a-mean-not-an-end”/">a prior blog post</a> in which I partly explain why the "Community" is a bit messed up.

Second,
<blockquote>this comment is almost laughable. Anti-intellectual? Pure passion?...what I think he was really trying to say was that feminists were too emotional about how they were victimized which inhibits all their ability to think on any rational or logic level. basically a lot of women got pissed and created a movement out of it. I never thought I'd ever be quoting Dinesh D'Souza, but as he would say, I think the train has left that station. Most that currently criticize the feminist movement don't use that sort of naive and uneducated criticisms anymore. Cause, like I said, it's straight up laughable.</blockquote>
I'll concede the point.

Third,
<blockquote>Most universities, that is, a hub for people to engage in intellectual thought, HAVE a women studies department. SO is it really "rational" and "logical" to claim that a university would spend money on an academic department that was thought to be "anti-intellectual?" and even looking at the bigger picture of feminism, I don't really see how breaking down the systemic ways that women have been historically oppressed in this country is anti-intellectual. This requires connecting complex theories with empricial data to make sense of the fucked up social fabrication of this culture. Oops, I said "fucked up," is that an illustration of my emotions inhibiting my ability to articulate myself, forcing me to resort to elementary curse words.</blockquote>
Unfortunately, the entire post breaks down here.  The fact that universities are (in a vacuum) a place of intellectual development, and that there are women's studies departments in universities, ends up being a contingent claim.  As an example, take the mathematics department.  In a vacuum, math would have all of the funding it would want, for it is vital in many other disciplines, plus pure math research is pretty important in its own right.  However, in reality, math departments often struggle to get funding, and the only way they are kept afloat is because other disciplines require their students to take the introductory calculus sequence from the math department.  If all of these departments created their own math classes for their own students, the math department would fall through the ground.  So really, funding for each program is often made on a more pragmatic level than we would like to assume...

Also, the conclusions that I've seen so far have been, for the most part, quite sweeping.  And I am pretty unhappy with the results that have come about as well: I am not saying this as a man, but as a person who would love to believe that people can be distinguished only by their merit (in academia), and not by their race, gender, etc.  There is a lot of anecdotal evidence that I can bring up which showed how artificial the checks and balances can be in order to make things "equal" for all people, like for instance, the attempt to make the IT workforce about 50/50 men and women.  Okay, so we'll reject a few men here and there for the sake of having women in the workforce, despite the possibility that the said men have IT as their passion, and said women end up not being all that passionate about IT.

Again, to reiterate my point, I am totally opposed to the current mainline methods of feminism, NOT to SOME of its conclusions.  There is another branch which I'd love to read more from, which is Analytic Feminism.
