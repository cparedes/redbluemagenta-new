I've been chairing the [LOPSA Mentorship Program][1] for the past few months;
I was approached by Lois Bennett about leading the program, and so I took
the helm, without much of any experience whatsoever.  I didn't really use
any methodologies that are already established as "best practices"; the Agile
framework definitely was an influence, but my style is to not be heavy handed
with much of anything.

I think the biggest thing that I learned to do is to always, always let the
team decide the best course of action.  My role is to only guide the
discussion, and make sure that any meetings don't last too long.  If I had
an opinion, I would throw it into the ring, but more often than not, it would
be torn apart by the rest of the team members; this is good, the best ideas
win when things are done this way, in my opinion.  If a discussion went on
for too long, I'd guide people to talk about it either on IRC or on the
mailing list, so we can get the meeting done faster.

**I never try to assert my position of power.**  I've never once considered
myself to be "above" anyone else - everyone else in the team are considerably
more experienced than me, and even if they weren't, it would do no one good
if I asserted my power at every discussion.  People need to be autonomous
and be able to say, without fear, what their opinion is.

We communicated over the phone once a week with a free conference call
provider, sussed out any minute details on our mailing list, and if anyone
wished, they could also talk to us through IRC.  The way we communicated was
already established before I started leading the program, and so it was
important to keep it the same.

I think, what's also important, is to always delegate the work.  This does
several things for you: one, it frees up your time so you can prepare for
more discussion; two, the people on the team are now accountable for getting
the things done, which, I suppose in theory, should empower the people on the
team.  It's not exactly good to be the leader and hog all the work.

I think, what I personally need to work on, is better organization, and
just simple "thank you's" to people.  Everyone's done a really great job,
and I'm not sure if I did such a great job in letting everyone know that.

Any sort of suggestions are welcome - I see my career sticking on the technical
track, but I figure that I'll be leading teams of people at work sometime
down the road.
