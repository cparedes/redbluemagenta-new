I want everyone to read <a href="http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=20693637&postcount=154">this post</a> on NeoGAF and then proceed to read the rest of this post.  The post on NeoGAF is about "university as a business" and the oversaturation of college graduates; it is a startling and quite insightful view on the state of American education, and how we are digging ourselves a grave with our never ending cycle of degree requirements in the industry and the promise of American education to fulfill that end.

One of the symptoms of this problem is a never ending supply of graduates who think that since they have a degree, their options are limitless and that they are part of the educated elite.  Unfortunately, this viewpoint automatically sabotages the person in question: if everyone thinks this and pursues this goal with that viewpoint in mind (and the environment allows for this), then obviously the population of people who have this goal in mind will increase and will become saturated.  However, I believe what's worse than this is that the common mindset is aligned more with the underbelly of marketing than with the ideals of old school University education; this further perpetuates the lowering of the value of today's bachelor's degree.  This is further amplified by the large gap between what the industry requires from graduates, and where the University has traditionally aligned its values.  The University has started to realign its values to match those of the industry, when the whole POINT of a University education is to teach values and subjects that are long lasting and move much slower than the ever changing industry.

This also causes us to reevaluate the true value of education: is it simply a nominal designation of achievement; that is, if we are "educated," is this simply another way of saying, "yes, I went through so and so program," or is it still rooted in a deep appreciation for the subjects that we are studying?  I suppose for some, the latter definition is what they hold true; for many others, the first definition is what they resonate with.  However, I think this problem has existed for quite a while, though I believe this issue has been amplified in today's world.

I've only a few pieces of advice for those who are still early in their academic career, or are considering college in the near future:

<ol>
<li>Don't study something just because it will make you a ton of money.  Study something because you love the subject.  The way you figure this out is to take as many classes as you can in various subjects, until you can't go on any further.  Many people figure out how to make a sufficient amount of money for how they live, no matter their degree.</li>
<li>Study a lot of different subjects.  Don't overspecialize in your undergraduate career, the whole point of an undergraduate education is to be as well-rounded as possible and to learn <em>how to think</em>; specialize in grad school, not in undergrad.</li>
<li>It's not the end of the world if you can't get into your favorite academic program.  Academia isn't the end point of your life.</li>
<li>Develop a deep appreciation of a problem in whatever field you want to get into.</li>
<li>Be humble when applying for jobs.  Just because you have a bachelor's degree, doesn't mean you'll get an awesome job.  This is especially true today, as explained above.  Everyone starts at the bottom.  And no, it's not the end of the world if you start at the bottom, it's only the beginning.</li>
</ol>
