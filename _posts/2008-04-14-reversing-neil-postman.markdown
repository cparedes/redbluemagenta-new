<p>I seem to have fell into an academic trap within the past year.</p>  <p>When I read Marshall McLuhan's <u>Understanding Media</u> - which I ought to read again - and Neil Postman's <u>Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business</u>, I've placed myself into a prescriptive role over media which has permeated throughout our society.&#160; I stood by books and other more traditional media as the only true arbiters of art and general knowledge, and have, in general, dismissed television, video games, and to a degree, the internet, as valid means of communicating information.&#160; At least McLuhan gives a bit of insight into this topic: he states that once we transform or change the medium, we change the message.&#160; Or to perhaps use his aphorism, &quot;the medium is the message.&quot;&#160; It is, then, easy to fall into a conundrum of dismissing any forms of media that falls outside communicative media outside of the Enlightenment: it was, of course, the age of huge intellectual growth, where man finally embraced reason over theism.</p>  <p>However, we could take the more descriptive route when talking about McLuhan's ideas and contend that while printed media has become a bit less popular than other media in this day and age, it does not necessarily mean that our society is dwindling down to an age of unreason.&#160; We can now assert that, yes, there is some validity in the &quot;art&quot; of the new media, and yes, we can finally remove those damned quotation marks around &quot;art&quot; when talking about television programs and video games.&#160; It is easy to construct a fairly strong argument as to why society is &quot;dwindling&quot; based on hindsight.&#160; It is, however, now clear to me that these arguments are the equivalent of snobbery, a sort of intellectual hide out where one may hold onto ideals of days gone by without realizing that the ideal that they have held onto has gone through the same criticism and contempt as the very thing that they are criticizing.&#160; To use Henry Jenkins' terminology, the art of the people, &quot;popular art,&quot; has always been snubbed in favor for the &quot;great arts,&quot; with imitators reminiscing of such &quot;great arts&quot; creating mediocre works of art, or, in other words, &quot;middle brow art.&quot;&#160; Popular art almost always becomes &quot;great art&quot; after the &quot;popular art&quot; is disassociated with contemporary society.</p>  <p>So, in any case, hopefully this realization will lend a bit more leeway and insight into any sort of questioning I have of a particular piece of art, whether it be video games, movies, or televised programs.</p>
