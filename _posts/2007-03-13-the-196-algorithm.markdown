Take any 2 digit (or higher) number and reverse the ordering of its digits.

[ example: Let the number be 110.  The reverse ordering will be 011. ]

Now add the two numbers together.

[ example: 110 + 011 = 121. ]

Keep doing this until you get a palindrome.  110, in this case, is a palindrome after one iteration of this algorithm.

The main crux of this algorithm is that the number 196 along with a specific sequence of numbers (Lychrel Numbers) does NOT net a palindrome with this algorithm.  It is, however, just a hypothesis and remains unproved so far if it does indeed have no palindrome associated with it.  So far, there's been records of people going through at least ten million iterations of the algorithm with no success so far in finding a palindrome associated with the number 196.

It seems like an interesting problem to check out...
