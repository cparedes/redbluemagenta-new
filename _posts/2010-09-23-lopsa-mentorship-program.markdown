We've launched the [LOPSA mentorship program][1] about a week ago, and we're
now soliciting for proteges and mentors to sign up for the program.

Why sign up for the LOPSA mentorship program even if you have great mentors
at work already?  We think that it only helps you, as a system administrator,
to have several mentors (if you already have one or two guiding you through
your career); if you don't already have a mentor, then you'll benefit greatly
by signing up for the program, no matter your skill level.

And for those wondering whether you should be a mentor or not, you don't
have to worry about where your skill level is at, either - you don't have to
have 10-15 years of experience in the field to help someone else.  It's also
one of the better ways to learn more about your field - helping someone with
a particular problem can also solidify your own skills in that particular
problem domain.

So, if you're wanting to be a protege, you don't have to be a LOPSA member -
it's totally free.  If you're wanting to be a mentor, you **do** have to be
a LOPSA member, though for a short period of time, you can [register][2] for
only $35.

Thanks everyone!  And be sure to [sign up][1] if you're interested!
