"God grant us the serenity to accept the things we cannot change, courage to change the things we can, and wisdom to know the difference."

I'm not very religious at all, but I find a lot of wisdom in the above quote; there's simply too many things that happen beyond our control, and most of what can be changed is simply within ourselves, or rather, within our interpretations of what's happening in front of us.

If we change our interpretations of the circumstances, we can change how we deal with them.  However, we are usually too locked in our thoughts and believe them to be completely true, whereas the opposite or any gradient between the two thoughts can be equally as true, given ample time to dissect the thought and reinterpret what's happening in front of us.

I actually just bought a book called "Loving What Is" by Byron Katie, and it talks a lot about how to simply accept the circumstances as they are rather than sticking with an INTERPRETATION of the circumstance.  Okay, so it's a self-help book, and this post sounds like a shameless advertisement, but the questions presented in the book that challenge our thoughts seem to be universal in terms of unraveling our sufferings with ourselves.  It's helping me quite a bit with what I've been thinking about lately.  I'll post the questions that it poses a little later, probably within a day or two.
