The film class I'm taking has been quite the ride so far; it's definitely an intellectually stimulating activity being in a seminar with a round table discussion on various aspects of film and Filipino-American culture.<br /><br />And, on top of that, we're finally going to be shooting film tomorrow!&nbsp; We've got my friend's Canon GL-1 on top of the Canon GL-2 that I'll be picking up from Kane Hall tomorrow afternoon, so we'll be going around shooting random footage of conversations, our OWN discussions on trying to figure out how to shoot a film, scenery, etc.<br /><br />It's all very random, but eh, I figure we'll figure something out once we cobble the footage together.<br />
