<p>First of all, I've transitioned my website over to <a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=8bc45a7ce694f24356ff5e8e62177650598f9ab1">Linode.com</a>, which is working out extremely well for me.  Second, I've opened up my <a href="http://www.redbluemagenta.com">front page</a> to the public finally, which showcases my portfolio and my resume.</p>

<p>Anyway, getting to the meat of this post, I've been meaning to rant for a while about vendor lock-in.  As a person working more on the technical side of things than on the management / business side, I've felt extremely frustrated when I'm locked in with a specific vendor; this means that my creativity as a problem solver is similarly boxed in as well.  Yes, I am a Linux advocate, but I use whatever is best for particular situations; for instance, I believe that Windows Servers are great for directory services.  However, it makes no sense to me to stick only with one platform simply because we've paid money for the whole thing.</p>

<p>For instance, there are common server applications on Linux which are much superior to anything that the Windows platform could offer, like Apache, Tomcat, Nagios, Cacti, RT, etc.  Granted, the first two applications are ported over to Windows, but Microsoft insists on an all Windows deployment: this means sticking with IIS.  The last three applications are, in fact, enterprise grade pieces of software.  And they are all free!</p>

<p>In any case, because Linux is free as in freedom, and since most, if not all of the apps are free as in freedom as well, there are no contracts or upfront fees to pay.  For an organization, it might require additional skilled personnel well versed in Linux, and it may require purchasing of support from some other vendor.  It may even require paying for training.  But if there's something broken in the software, then either the IT department fixes it, or they replace it at will.  There are no budget limitations after the initial costs are out of the way.  This is why I do not like vendor lock-in; it does not allow me to consider the last option, which is to replace the software quickly in order to fix the problem.  I simply want to get things done, and sometimes, deploying and culling workstations/servers/software/whatever at-will must be an option for me if I want to fix the issue, and sometimes it will have to be OSS software, which often has no vendor.</p>
