<p><a href="http://get.live.com/writer/overview">Windows Live Writer</a> is a damn nice Windows based blogging client.&#160; It supports all sorts of things that most blog software supports, like tagging, separate excerpts, etc.&#160; It links very well with Movable Type and WordPress, which is of course a huge plus.&#160; But yeah, it's probably one of the best blogging clients around, even when compared to anything else on Linux or Mac OS X.</p>  <p>If you like to blog, you'd probably want to check out it out, it's well worth the download.</p>  <p>(I'm writing pretty much all of my blog posts these days on WLW. :))</p>
