So, I checked out Ted Leo and The Pharmacists last night at The Vera Project.
They played a really solid set - I'm not too big of a fan, but I like their
music enough to justify checking them and the opening bands out.

The sole opening band for Ted Leo, [Past Lives], features the
multi-instrumentalist from [Champagne Champagne] as the drummer, and a few
other guys who I haven't seen before.  But hey, they were all solid, and I
could only describe their music as being a somewhat more "artful"
Mars Volta.  I'd probably see them again if they were opening for another
band.

The shirts that the band members were wearing during Ted Leo's set were
tributes to an awesome punk band called [Jeff and The Brotherhood]. I've
checked out their music on MySpace, was amazed by it, then was subsequently
disappointed that they weren't planning to hit Seattle anytime soon.  But
when they come around, I'll definitely have to check them out.
