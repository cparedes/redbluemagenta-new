<p>My classes are awesome.</p>  <p>CHID 205 (Method, Imagination &amp; Inquiry): This is probably the best class out of the four that I'm taking.&#160; I really love how my professor brings subtle details out into the light, as well as cultural contexts and how that plays into the difficulty in answering a question or even coming up with a question in the first place (for instance, how can we even dream of asking the question, &quot;do we have a soul,&quot; if the soul is assumed to be there in the first place?)&#160; That, and I love his sense of humor; his wit drips in almost sentence he speaks in lecture.</p>  <p>PHIL 433 (Philosophy of Aristotle): This seems to be a pretty hardcore course.&#160; There's only one ten page paper due at the end of term with absolutely no tests and quizzes.&#160; That, and Aristotle is pretty damn tough to read: there's tons of very specific definitions he uses for common words, lots of footnotes that try to clarify the text, a lot of use of a primitive form of logic, and his culmination of works that we have today are incomplete and are of things that weren't supposed to be disseminated for public use.&#160; It's still very interesting stuff, if at least in terms of historical context.</p>  <p>MATH 442 (Differential Geometry I): I love this course as well.&#160; It's fairly easy so far since it's all stuff we've covered in calculus III (that is, vector calculus in 2 and 3 dimensions), but it's supposedly going to increase in difficulty quite a bit within a week or two.&#160; Eh, I need the challenge at a time when I can finally concentrate on my work. :)</p>  <p>And finally,</p>  <p>ENGL 499 (Independent Study): We've met for the first time today in order to get the reading and film lists squared away.&#160; I'm REALLY looking forward for the discussions we'll have in the next few weeks, plus this is the first time I've done something like this in my college career; I have a feeling that this will be a very rewarding experience.</p>  <p>Yep.</p>  <p>Peace and love.</p>
