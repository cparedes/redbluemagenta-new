I have a few maxims that I follow when dealing with the issue of gaining knowledge.  Should we totally trust our intuitions when approaching phenomena?  Should we totally doubt our intuitions?  What about methods, should we adopt empiricism wherever we go?  In any case, here's what I personally adopt as a set of maxims when dealing with these problems:<div><br /></div><div><ul><li>Intuition is both to be trusted and to not be trusted.  A corollary to this is that we ought to not overgeneralize, but also we also ought to not totally distrust our cognitive capacity to tie phenomena together in order to postulate a working concept about the phenomena observed.</li><li>Argue from causes, not from principles. (Bacon)</li><li>Know that any working theory is just that: a working theory.  It may break down at any given time. (Peirce)</li><li>There is no "absolute truth."</li><li>What truth we obtain from science is, again, a working theory, but it is the best method we have so far in investigating truth.</li><li>Intuitions shape the way the world organizes itself in front of us.  This is to not be trusted when investigating TRUTH, but is essential since we cannot "turn off" our intuitions.</li><li>Arguments from emotion are especially misleading, as it carries our intuitions too far and eschews empirical evidence as much as possible in favor for what "feels right," and not for what "is right."</li></ul></div>
