Well well, here's my tentative schedule for Winter 2008:

MATH 403 (Introduction to Modern Algebra II): 9:30 - 10:20 AM, MWF
MATH 425 (Foundations of Analysis II): 11:30 AM - 12:20 PM, MWF
GERMAN 102: 12:30 - 1:20 PM, M-F
CHID 205 (Methods and Imagination): 1:30 - 2:30 PM, M-F

CHID 205 should be great, I've heard that though it covers many philosophers and writers, it is NOT a simple overview class, which I'm really happy about.  It's also very much focused on philosophy though it is under the CHID designation, so that is great as well, though I'm also disappointed that it won't really count toward a philosophy major.

In any case, I'm sucking in my two math classes right now (MATH 402 and MATH 424) and I really really hope I at least pass them so I can move on to the next set of classes.  I've just been doing terribly in all of my classes this quarter due to just being totally unmotivated (though I DO want to do well in these classes, it's just mostly this quarter where I've been totally removed from my school work in general.)

Here's hoping I'll do okay in this quarter so I don't get my financial aid cut off.
