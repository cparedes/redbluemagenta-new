I found out just now that there is a school of thought in feminism called "Analytic Feminism," which uses the analytic philosophy tradition (which is marked by the pursuit of clarity of language, logical analysis, etc.)<br /><br />I still cannot totally agree with feminist thought on a few key points, but I will definitely try reading into some of the articles published under the "Analytic Feminism" school of thought, as I can at least agree with the methodology that they employ in order to argue their points.<br />
