First of all, I ended up failing ALL four classes last quarter, which puts a huge damper on my education, but eh, whatever.<br /><br /><ul><li>CHID 205: Methods &amp; Imagination</li><li>MATH 442: Differential Geometry</li><li>PHIL 433: Philosophy of Aristotle</li><li>ENGL (or C LIT) ???: Some sort of film making class on Filipino American issues<br /></li></ul>I'm really excited for the film making class.  I've been wanting to get into film making for a while, not to mention that this will be a great way to find out more about my own culture.<br /><br />Differential geometry should be awesome as well.  I'm really thankful that I even got in the class in the first place, seeing that I failed all of the 400 level math classes that I've taken at the UW so far.  This isn't stopping me mentally from taking these classes, though; I just need to get my ass in gear and I'll be fine.<br /><br />Philosophy of Aristotle should be great, though I hear the readings are going to be REALLY REALLY REALLY fucking dry.<br /><br />Finally, Methods &amp; Imagination should be awesome; we will be reading Faulkner, Wittgenstein and other stuff with a philosophical lens, plus I hear nothing but great things about both the class and the professor.  I'm going to have a great time with this class.
