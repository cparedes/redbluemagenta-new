I'm going to start a series of posts that will offer a bit of my thoughts on a book I'm going to trudge through for the next two months.  The book is called <u>The Culture of Narcissism: American Life in an Age of Diminishing Expectations</u> by Christopher Lasch.  I've read through the preface and started the first chapter, and already I'm finding myself agreeing with many of the propositions that the author brings forth in his introduction of the book.

In any case, I'm simply going to list down a bunch of various fragmented thoughts on what's in the book, which will probably be the format that will follow in the next few posts.

Society has turned from a culture that values historicity to one that values the present over everything else; that is, we start to look at history as nostalgia rather than as a continuum leading up to the present day, which has the consequence of also eliminating looking toward the future, since we do not think that the future will consider the present as relevant (in other words, there is no historical context.)

We have turned toward the self as a bit of an extreme interpretation of the basis of American society - the pursuit of happiness - and as a result, bankrupted the value of interactions with those around us.

Great quote at the beginning of the first section:

<blockquote>The Marivaudian being is, according to Poulet, a pastless futureless man, born anew at every instant.  The instants are points which organize themselves into a line, but what is important is the instant, not the line.  The Marivaudian being has in a sense no history.  Nothing follows from what has gone before.  He is constantly surprised.  He cannot predict his own reaction to events.  He is constantly being <i>overtaken</i> by events.  A condition of breathlessness and dazzlement surrounds him.
- Donald Barthelme</blockquote>

It seems to sum up the overall message that I've seen so far in the first section: the modern, narcissistic man has no historicity and thus has no guidance through his journey.

The main motivators for narcissism after the 60's seem to be fueled mostly by survivalist ideals; living in the now and relishing in the moment versus living as a continuation of your ancestors and living as a seed for future generations.

That's it for now, more notes later!
