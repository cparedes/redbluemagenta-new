<p>I'm attempting to follow a career path to becoming a UNIX sysadmin.  On paper, it sounds like the most rewarding profession out of everything I've looked at, and I already love administering and deploying Linux/BSD systems, though I've only had to deal with maybe ten privately networked nodes in a Beowulf cluster at most.  I've started to install four *NIX operating systems in VMWare Workstation, such as OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Slackware, and Solaris (and maybe I'll add another Slackware server via PXE boot), all of them taking on different roles in a virtualized network.  I've been adding in more and more Debian boxes at my current job to do different fringe roles; one of them acts as an imaging server, another one acts as a network monitoring box, and I'm hoping to add another box as a test box for different web applications.</p>

<p>There's a hell of a lot to learn, though I'm finding that it's extremely satisfying to figure how something works in a UNIX environment.</p>

<p>I've ordered three books so far in order to aid me in this task: "The Practice of System and Network Administration" by Limoncelli, "UNIX System Administration Handbook" by Nemeth, and "Principles of Network and System Administration" by Burgess.  These books are heavily recommended by <a href="http://sage.org">SAGE</a>.  However, there does not seem to be much of anything in terms of a traditional career path to becoming a UNIX sysadmin: most stories I have read about usually involves someone who happened to know UNIX in the right place at the right time, and informally became the sysadmin of a particular department.</p>

<p>Anyway, that's my career goal so far, and I figure that it will take me a few years in order to get to that point.  We'll see.</p>
