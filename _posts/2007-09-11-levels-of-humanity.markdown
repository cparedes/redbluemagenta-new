(NOTE: I'm not religious at all.  It could possibly be construed that I am from this post, but... yeah, I'm not. :p)

I've heard a lot of positions based around doing an act that is typically against the precepts of various religions by using the argument that we are simply being "human": since we have natural impulses to, say, have sex with multiple partners or to move from partner to partner when the passion dies down, it is natural and is possibly morally ambiguous (versus strictly morally wrong or right) to act upon said impulses.

I somewhat accepted this explanation and went along my way, though I still thought that following some sort of philosophy or religion would be the best way to refine one's views on these various hot issues.  However, in a conversation I had a while ago, the guy I was talking to brought up a really good point about this issue: he said that there is not a single "base humanity" that we all follow, but rather, there are in reality different "levels" of humanity.  For instance, acting upon sexual impulses right away would lend itself to a more instinctual and baser styling of humanity, while humbling yourself and helping others with compassion would hint toward a higher sense of humanity that require us to override our instincts.

Thus, it could be argued that the precepts of religions are not exactly "anti-human" as some would argue, but rather, are higher levels of humanity that require an "overriding" of the lower levels of humanity (or I guess, a subduing of our baser instincts).

I suppose some of the things that people see in religions or whatever else are the hypocrites: the hypocrites are the ones who obfuscate the higher levels of humanity and steer people's intuition from that to the baser levels of self-gain, deceit, and impulsiveness.

Anyway, I suppose what I'm trying to say is that while there are natural tempting things to do as a part of our natural humanity, we do not have to follow them necessarily, because it's not the ONLY level of humanity that we can follow.
