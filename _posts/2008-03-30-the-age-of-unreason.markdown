This blog post was spurned by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/-fWJH5KG9jc">this interview of biographer Andrew Morton</a>.

(side note: my views on Scientology will not be expressed in this blog post)

In any case, he made a very good point in the last minute or two of the video: we live in an age that has retrogressed toward a period that was previous to the Age of Enlightenment, where we follow ideologies blindly rather than conduct inquiries into our collectively accepted beliefs in order to suss out any inconsistencies that exist in the belief in question.  This goes for both religious ideologies and secular ideologies that exist today.

Today, we find ourselves fighting religious precepts without stopping and analyzing the stance that we assume, whether it be from a theistic or atheistic viewpoint.  In fact, I would say that the "New Atheism" that exists today is equally as inconsistent as any religious doctrines that atheists charge for being inconsistent.  We also find that most of our beliefs of the world are rooted in rhetoric rather than in well articulated and consistent arguments.  The questions we ought to ask ourselves are, "why do I believe this?  How did I come to accepting this belief?"  Once we conduct an inquiry into our own beliefs through these two questions, we will find that it is often rooted in our upbringing or a collective acceptance of the belief in question, rather than in any well conducted inquiry that would prove our beliefs to be correct.

In any case, I find it extremely important for us to inquire into our beliefs and be as self-critical as possible; we should not simply accept beliefs that float around in our society with conviction, but rather, we should accept facts/beliefs after it has been scrutinized, picked apart, and shown to be consistent with the world.<br />
