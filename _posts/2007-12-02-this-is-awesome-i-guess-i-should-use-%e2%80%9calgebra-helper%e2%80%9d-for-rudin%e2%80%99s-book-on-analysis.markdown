So, I was looking on the web for solutions on Rudin's "Principles of Mathematical Analysis" (yeah, I know Ben, this is blasphemy. :))

I came across a link that looked really promising.  But then, well... first, here's the link: <a href="http://www.algebra-answer.com/algebra-helper/rudin-principles-of-mathematical-analysis-solutions.html">http://www.algebra-answer.com/algebra-helper/rudin-principles-of-mathematical-analysis-solutions.html</a>.

Basically, it's probably an automatically generated "forum thread" that substitutes in whatever book name in a template.  Then "algebra_guy" suggests that instead of "chewing on your pencil" and "asking parents for answers," the frustrated analysis student should instead use "Algebra Helper."

Except the problem is, this is analysis, not algebra.

algebra_guy is dumb. :D
