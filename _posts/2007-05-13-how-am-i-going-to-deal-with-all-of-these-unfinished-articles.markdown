I have something like ten blog posts that are sitting in the drafts folder of my blog waiting to be finished.  About half of them already have an essay's worth typed up, others have one paragraph, and some simply only have the title typed in and nothing else.

It could have to do with the fact that I find inspiration to write something at around 3:00 AM every night, though the fact that me wanting to sleep at 3:00 AM doesn't help things at all.  In any case, you might see a bunch of posts sometime in the near future.  Hopefully.
