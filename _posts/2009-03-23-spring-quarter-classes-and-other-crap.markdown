Twenty credits.  Here they are:

PHIL 472: Axiomatic Set Theory
PHIL 460: Philosophy of Science
PHIL 120: Intro. to Logic
AAS 308: Basic Tagalog

 I can't wait for 472 myself; I've been clamoring for math for a while, and though this isn't in the math department, it will have to do for now.

This is going to be my final quarter in college as well.

As much as I want to start working, I also want to keep going in college... but I think this is just me being a bit sentimental about a period of time which I won't be able to live through again.

My college career was filled with a lot of uncertainties and doubts, as well as a lot of slacking after working hard for a year or two.  I learned a few extremely good lessons, things which ultimately turned my life from being asocial to being much more social, and then I learned more things which subdued my demeanor quite a bit.  But overall, I've learned a lot about myself over these past five years (and I've learned a lot, of course, from my classes), and I wouldn't give up these five years for <em>anything</em>.  I'm sure everyone who has been through college would say the same thing about the whole experience.

The truth of the matter is, I totally lost myself almost two years ago or so.  Before that, I was an extremely nerdy kid who spent all of his time on homework and didn't know any better about how to socialize.  I eventually learned how to socialize, went into my first relationship, then I've started to downspiral following the breakup.  I honestly think that that was my watershed moment, where I honestly started to give some thought about who I was, what I was doing, and what was actually important in life.  I was already trying to change myself before getting into my first relationship, but after getting hit with what seemed like a ton of bricks at the time, I was wondering if this sort of change was actually something that was mostly genuine.  And I think, now, all of this changing, thinking about my life, etc. has culminated into me getting back into what I used to do: doing crap with computers.  I've also learned to welcome back my old self and cherish it.  This is probably why I'm clamoring to get out of college: because I know, now, exactly what I love doing.

But I also have some lingering regrets, which, when combined with my sentiments about these past five years, shows a somewhat better picture as to why I want to stay in college.  For instance, I failed A LOT of math classes because I both didn't have the intellectual drive to actually put in the hours of work required for the classes, and I also wasn't in the right place in my life at that time.  If I had time and money, I would absolutely <em>love</em> to stay in college and retake those classes now that I have a little bit more clarity in my life.  I also regret the worst quality about me, which is my laziness; I loved the subjects, but I had no <em>tenacity</em> when it came down to actually doing the work.  And that, I think, was also what killed me in my college career.

In any case, I'm going to miss college.  I've learned a lot in my courses, finally found a solid starting point for the rest of my life, and I've made a lot of good friends as well.

Two and a half more months until I'm out of this joint!
