<p>I've managed to collect a good sized stack of books (about 8 - 10) over the past quarter, which I haven't even made a dent in.&#160; There's another handful of books that my friends have been wanting me to read, and yet another handful from the library that I have to start on before they're due (though I guess I can always renew them for the... fourth time now?)</p>  <p>Shit, I'm going to have a busy Spring Break.</p>
