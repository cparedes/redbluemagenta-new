Hahah, I was reading through the introduction of "The Art of Programming" by Donald Knuth, and he had an example set of problems that demonstrated his problem difficulty rating system.

Here was the third question:

[M50]: Prove that when n is an integer, n > 2, the equation x^n + y^n = z^n has no solution in positive integers x, y, z.

(M50 is M = math oriented question, 50 = research [extremely tough] problem)

For those who don't know what the question is or why I put it up there, it is Fermat's Last Theorem, which at the time of writing was unsolved (the book was first published in the 60's, and Fermat's Last Theorem was proved correct in the 90's.)  Fermat's Last Theorem was actually one of the longest unresolved math problems in math history...

I've gotta say, Knuth has a great sense of humor and wit.
