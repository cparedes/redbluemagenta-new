American politics nowadays is very shortsighted and is filled with blind idealism and whatever else; or perhaps I should say, our thoughts on current American politics today is very idealistic and is pretty much the same between any other person in the Democratic/Republican party.  This somewhat goes along with the overall trend of society matched with uniformity that is cemented within the consumerist ideals; in other words, our thoughts have increasingly become uniform as consumerism took hold on our society, along with the introduction of TV as a major medium of entertainment.  This has huge implications on the way we think about politics where it is now more about showmanship and circus acts on TV and on stage of the general societal theater of America.

I was somewhat talking (well, more like listening) to two guys debating about intervention in countries such as Darfur, Iraq and Burma.  One person was debating along the lines of, "the only reason why we protest the invasion of Iraq is because it's Bush," whereas the other person said something along the lines of, "why go into Iraq, we should intervene in Darfur, Burma, etc."  After the latter person had to go, I talked a bit with the other guy.  He made a great point that I agree with completely: we should simply let them figure it out on their own since they have a completely different political/social lineage than we do.  To add to that, we should let them deal with it on their own since, in general, the forceful thrusting of ideals eventually falls apart due to the lack of hindsight on how the culture operates, e.g., Vietnam, Russia, Iraq, etc.  The thrusting of democracy or even the meddling in the affairs of other countries will send them closer to a quagmire due to the shock of ideals that was not borne from a natural manifestation of ideas.

Maybe one thing to note, if only going on anecdotal evidence, is that successful transformations of society and political thought is unconscious.  That is, our creation of a representative democracy was inevitable due to the overall climate of European government as well as geographical separation.

It is not necessarily bad to have a more "primitive" form of government, nor is it necessarily good to always have a democracy forcefully implemented.  The only way a successful democracy is born is through an overall unconscious movement toward those ends.

This is also the reason why I think direct intervention of Darfur, Burma, etc. is not necessarily the best thing to do.  In the sense of the American view of what we ought to do when poor looking people are in trouble, it's an easy choice of throwing military at the problem and defend the poor looking people from the oppressors.  However, when we do that, we also go there with a stained perspective; again, we only look through the American lens, so our view of humanitarian aid is very "Sally Struthers-like"; our humanitarian action is another's meddling in political affairs, and so we end up in a quagmire that starts off with two sides totally polarized with one obviously supporting the Americans, and then it starts to level off and both groups start to equally dislike our presence.

To take other events from history, we can look at the European Imperialist period where the European powers divided Africa up between themselves and pushed Western ideas and technologies onto the peoples of these countries, who have had no true natural development of its society that would accommodate such drastic changes.  The technology and ideals forcefully thrown into these countries have created nationalism in a country that had no such preconceived notions of such an idea, divisions within countries, shifting of the atomic familial unit, etc.  The forceful shock of an idea or technology creates divisions between people; a sort of "detribalizing," as McLuhan would put it.

In any case, if you're wondering why I'm so apathetic to politics, read the above.
