I'm fucked.

I already got an email from my German TA about my poor performance, I'm not doing so hot in my two math classes judging by my homework grades and midterm results, though I AM doing okay in my Philosophy of Religion class.

I'm sure I'll get academic probation by the end of this quarter.  And I'll be fucked.  But whatever, life goes on, and I'm sure that I can concentrate much better next quarter when I start fresh, IF there's a next quarter.

And if there isn't, I'll just read shit on my own. :>
