I have a bit of a conundrum; maybe some of you guys who are involved in teaching could convince me otherwise.

I love teaching stuff to other people in whatever capacity that I can muster.  Seeing people finally understand a concept that I've been trying to teach in many different angles is simply fucking awesome.

However, I've been reading <a href="http://www.edutopia.org/muddle-machine">a few</a> <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html">articles</a>, <a href="http://www.wheresthemath.com/blog2/">websites</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymvSFunUjx0">watched</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr1qee-bTZI&amp;feature=channel_page">a lot</a> of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyHER6o-4x0&amp;feature=channel_page">videos</a> on the realities of K-12 education in the United States (especially on mathematics education, something which I was thinking about going into), and to me, the entire system seems to be a huge monster of mediocrity, disallowing anyone (teachers, textbook editors, students) from presenting any sort of ingenuity.

I remember learning from those god awful textbooks that the first link describes.  When was it ever interesting for someone to write multiple steps in order to solve a math problem involving an ice cream man?  I suppose the textbook editors / writers are trying to show us how "useful" and "fun" math can be, but all they are doing is constraining us to a set of banal examples which only restricts our world view on how applicable math can be.

But you might think about this and say, "well, kids really would be lost if you lay the heavy math on them!  How can X, Y, or Z be useful if it can't be translated into a problem that kids can understand?"  I'm inclined to think that if we do not give any intellectual charity to these kids, then they will either become frustrated or will become constrained within the bounds that we've set up for them.  For instance, I remember matrices being introduced in one of my high school math classes just because the curriculum demanded that the kids needed to learn the largest amount of concepts as possible.  However, the usage of matrices never amounted to anything more than simply learning how to actually add and multiply them together; how surprised I was to learn several years later that there was a lot of "deep" results to be had with matrices that could have been "dumbed down" a little bit for high school consumption.  For instance, any linear transformation can be represented as a matrix.  Rotations are linear transformations (thus, it can be represented as a matrix).  Multiplying two rotations together is another rotation.  These things, as intuitive and easy as they sound, have far reaching consequences, both in the theory and in applications (if you had a student in a high school class who was interested in math and in computer games, just tell them that all of the fancy 3D graphics rendering has to do with matrices).

In a lot of ways, I think school textbooks should be written by a few key authors with no constraints whatsoever, <em>just like in college</em>.  College textbooks written by a few people <a href="http://www.edutopia.org/muddle-machine#comment-60303">end up having less errors</a>, anyway.

The problem doesn't end here, however.  The textbook market is simply a part of a larger problem in our education system.  The strict adherence to a district wide curriculum is also troublesome, though I know that some of the better teachers often drift away from such a constraint while staying within the standard.  Imagine if literature classes were taught out of a heavily edited anthology, so that it contains none of the more "colorful" authors and none of the politically incorrect works from famous authors!  We would, again, be constrained in safety from such works, so that our minds would not be polluted with such subversive thoughts!  Imagine if we had to teach creationism as <em>science</em> (it's not, for the mere fact that it is not falsifiable; it belongs in a philosophy course, not in science.)

In any case, I really would love to teach, but I fear that the public school system would hold me to the fire if I didn't comply with the culture of mediocrity that they've bred in the United States.

Maybe you guys can give some insight in this?
