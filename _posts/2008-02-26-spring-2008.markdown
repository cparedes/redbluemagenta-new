<p>LING 200: Introduction to Linguistic Thought   <br />PHIL 320: Ancient Philosophy    <br />CHID 498: Poetics of Play in Digital Games</p>  <p>Yep, that means, no more math for next quarter.&nbsp; I definitely need the break in order to REALLY figure things out in terms of what I want to delve into in graduate school - that is, if I ever do go into graduate school.&nbsp; I figure a linguistics class will help me out in terms of studying analytic philosophy, and the CHID class should help a little in terms of getting into literary analysis in mediums not necessarily related to any sort of traditional modes of discourse.</p>  <p>"Ancient Philosophy" is just, well, ancient philosophy.&nbsp; It's to get my philosophy requirements out of the way, though I'm sure it would be interesting.&nbsp; I REALLY wanted to get into "Modern Philosophy" or "British Empiricism," but they either conflicted with my schedule or had prerequisites that I don't have fulfilled yet.&nbsp; Gayed.</p>  <p>Well, there's my schedule for ya.</p>
