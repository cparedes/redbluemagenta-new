<p>I found this quote from Twitter.com very quaint:</p>  <blockquote>Twitter puts you in control and becomes a modern antidote to information overload.</blockquote>  <p>Twitter, however, from at least its description on the website, is simply yet another application that adds to the disarray of information that is mostly irrelevant. What problem does this solve? Or rather, is this EVEN a solution? Is knowing about what a friend is doing at an exact moment truly relevant? Would knowing a piece of disconnected information do anything for us? Perhaps Twitter, along with say Facebook and Myspace, help to disseminate irrelevancy to even higher levels than what TV could do, by democratizing the process and at least give the illusion that all of the information coming into the screen is truly relevant, when in fact it was not needed in the first place.</p>  <p>Meh. More on this subject later, I've a lot more stuff to read. ;p</p>
