I'll get to the whole Magpie thing in a minute, but first, I wanted to enumerate my thoughts on animal rights that have been in the back burner for quite a while.

I have been on the fence about animal rights for quite a while now, and to be honest, I hadn't given much thought to the whole thing until it was brought up in a conversation between me and Sara a few months back.  Being quite unfamiliar with the arguments in favor for animal rights as well as having no real stake in the subject (I haven't had any pets, and my family raised me on meat all through my life), I've been pretty interested in learning about what arguments testify for animal rights, while at the same time, staying as skeptical as possible.  Now, I wanted to stay skeptical because, to me, I do not know anything at all about animal rights, nor do I know much about the counter-arguments from meat advocates.  That, and I feel that, granted, if say we had totally sussed out the ethics involved in animal rights, then what good would it do when there are economies established totally around meat production? What about biology, where research is dependent on genetically modified mice?  I do like the ultimate goal of animal rights advocates, which I believe is to end all animal cruelty, exploitation, and killing.  I just, at this point in time, cannot attach myself totally to the cause, because I think there's more work to be done to really justify the claims of both animal rights advocates and its detractors.  But good on ya, if you support animal rights.

And that's about where I am at right now in trying to figure out everything in my head about the animal rights issue.  I suppose this is where I start introducing the whole Magpie article.
