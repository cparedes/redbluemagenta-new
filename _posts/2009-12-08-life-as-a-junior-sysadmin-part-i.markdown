<p>I'm finally relaxing more and more into my de facto role as a junior sysadmin at my current job.  So far, things are looking fairly messy; there's a lot of infrastructure that still needs to be built, especially setting up systems and network monitoring.  We're extremely blind until something breaks, which then we have to go out to the premise and bring the service back up.  I've been reading a few blogs and books, such as "<a href="http://www.everythingsysadmin.com/">Everything Sysadmin</a>" and "Practice of System and Network Administration"; one take away message so far is to move the sysadmin team away from dealing with systems issues reactively and more toward having awareness before a service breaks down completely (when I say completely, I mean the time when a service is unusable for any group of people for any given reason.)  I find that there's a lot of things to learn in this area, especially with just setting up stuff for collecting data via SNMP, syslog, etc.</p>

<p>Further, I've been working more and more toward improving processes in our day to day dealings with systems, especially when it comes to imaging computers (our tool of choice is using an unattended installation server with software from <a href="http://unattended.sf.net">unattended.sf.net</a>), automating actions, etc.  It seems a bit harder than it looks, especially when dealing with Windows servers; there seems to be a lot of things in Windows that cannot be automated in a standard way.</p>

<p>In any case, there's a long way to go to improve the health of our systems, but we're getting there slowly.</p>
