(WORD OF WARNING: Like a lot of my rants, this particular piece doesn't have any citation to any sources at all, mostly because I'm too lazy to look up the stuff that I've already read.  If you want to confirm/disprove any of the facts, go right ahead, I won't stop you. :))

I caught myself wandering around the UW campus again for an hour or two.

I was thinking of a lot of things, mostly reflecting inward and shuffling through a few loose ends.  However, after I started heading back to my house, something clicked in my head, something that I was ruminating about for a couple of months but was confirmed once I started walking back to my house: humans NEED companionship.

Of course it's true, this sort of necessity of companionship is seen in almost all social animals, but for humans, there are usually other distractions that pull individuals toward relative isolation, especially in modern, urban society.  The effects of this sort of isolation, while kept at bay with NEW STUFF, can be quite damaging; this isn't restricted to humans (except for the "new stuff" part, I don't think animals care about "new stuff"), I believe there was a bit of research done with various animals which proved that isolation leads to the inability to communicate and relate to others, which translates almost perfectly to human behavior.

In any case... well, I suppose the main thing that I'm trying to get at is that there's a lot of disconnection between individuals; it doesn't help that our generation (that is, the current 16-24 year olds) are proven to be the most narcissistic generation ever, but indeed the narcissism and disconnection seems to be markedly connected with the trends of American culture and the marginalization of the individual in commercialism and whatnot.

I doubt there's a solution to this problem, at least not a solution that we could actively contribute to.  It DOES help if we take the conscious effort to at least be a bit more open, but that alone does not change societal and cultural trends...

(PS: This is probably a very ignorant post; maybe within a few days/weeks/years my stance and knowledge on this issue will change.  We'll see.)
