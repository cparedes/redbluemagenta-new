(this is mostly a paraphrasing of McLuhan's analysis of the effects of media with a few comments on how it relates to our society today)

McLuhan: "Socially, it is the accumulation of group pressures and irritations that prompt invention and innovation as counter-irritants."

To relate to contemporary society, we are shocked both physiologically and psychologically when we find that we have little to no celebrity status amongst our peers, or when we fail terribly at social life that we end up in a downward spiral.  Some try to compensate for the metaphorical hole in our chests through activities that either provide another outlet for celebrity (like for instance, Youtube), or anything else that would numb the shock that has overridden our senses in our body (playing online games, chatting on discussion forums, etc.)  In essence, we have a tendency to "autoamputate" the senses that have been shocked through extensions that numb the senses, like for instance, the wheel to the foot; the wheel's nature lends itself to numbing the foot's existence by making the foot do a repetitive rotating motion or, today, abstract the wheel from the foot even further by making the foot do an action that is not directly related to the wheel's movement.

When we do not have such faculties available for autoamputation, we look for other ways to quell our irritations and nausea when we are shocked and are put into a situation where we must compensate through numbing our senses.  The noises of city life for instance, a cacophonous combination of chatter and various other noises, requires a reharmonization that quells our irritation of the dissonance around us.  To counter this irritant, the Walkman was invented.  We also have people on the streets that carry their guitars around and play them for money, because they know that people need this sort of reharmonization in order to quell their irritations.  Now, we have iPods and other MP3 devices that have considerably lowered the amount of chatter in the city, yet it seems that we have also, in effect, "detribalized" ourselves.

(A quick aside: I was on the 28 Metro bus heading back to my house from school trying to read a book.  I had my earphones on while listening to my iPod, which then it occurred to me after I looked up that everyone else was doing the same thing; I then removed my earphones and had a much quieter environment in which to read in.  Ahh, the joys of the damned iPod.)

Much like our autoamputative response to any physiological shock to our bodies (when we fall unexpectedly one or two feet down from a ledge, our bodies tend to numb the pain right away until we return to normal), we have autoamputative responses to psychological shocks in the form of technological extensions of our bodies.

Perhaps this lends itself to a hint to the question that I posed earlier: will I be able to sever myself from technology?  Maybe it is impossible, since it is now almost a permanent extension to my body as it is for everyone else; the nausea that permeates society is quelled by technology, and so, we have dependence toward our devices in order to properly numb the shocks that we experience otherwise.  The socially not-so-acclimated man would have to retreat behind technology or other extensions of the body in order to save face; because of the inventions that have been developed since computers have arrived on the scene, he may delve into online games where he can communicate in a certain language that is not necessarily socially acceptable anywhere else, or maybe delve into hobbies that provide comfort and do not require social participation, etc.
