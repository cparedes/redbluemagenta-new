1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 .... = 1/2

Weird shit.  Look at the following:

(1 - 1) + (1 - 1) + ... = 0

but

1 + (-1 + 1) + (-1 + 1) ... = 1

Furthermore, let's treat it as a regular infinite series with partial sums:

S = 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 ...
1 - S = 1 - (1 - 1 + 1 - 1 .... ) = 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 ... = S

1 - S + S = 1 = 2S (since 1 - S = S)
thus, S = 1/2

This is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandi%27s_series">Grandi's Series</a>.  It's practically equivalent to the geometric series with r = -1.  Weird shit, eh?

You can also solve the problem with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ces%C3%A0ro_summation">Ces√†ro summation</a>.

But yeah, just show people the equation and watch as they try to solve the problem
