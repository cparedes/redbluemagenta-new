Alright, I've transitioned the blog from WordPress to Movable Type.&nbsp; Movable Type seems a lot more powerful in many respects, so I'm going to stick with it from here on out.&nbsp; It's a hell of a lot easier to deal with multiple blogs on the same domain as well and I DO plan on doing that on my website.
